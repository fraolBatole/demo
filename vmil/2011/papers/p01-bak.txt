Designing the Dart programming language with a simple virtual machine in mind

By Lars Bak

Modern programming languages are often designed without considerations for the
underlying execution engines. In many cases, this leads to systems that are
slow, complicated, memory bloated, and therefore error prone. This talk will
present a new structured web programming language where the underlying virtual
machine has been designed along with the language. We will also discuss the
results of this approach with respect to simplicity, scalability, and
performance.

Lars Bak is a veteran virtual machinist. His passion for designing and
implementing object-oriented virtual machines has left marks on several
software systems: Beta, Self, Strongtalk, Sun's HotSpot and CLDC HI, OOVM
Smalltalk, and V8. Since joining Google in the fall of 2006, Lars has been
responsible for the design and implementation of V8. In case you wonder, V8 is
the accelerator that makes Google Chrome fast. Lars graduated in 1988 with a MS
degree in computer science from Aarhus University.
