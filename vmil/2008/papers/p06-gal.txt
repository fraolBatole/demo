Compiling the Web--Building a Just-in-Time Compiler for JavaScript

Abstract:
Over the last decade we have made great strides towards improving
the execution performance of virtual-machine (VM) based high level
programming languages. Today, dynamic compilation is standard in
most Java and C# VMs, enabling programs written in these languages
to execute with similar efficiency as legacy type-unsafe C or
assembly code.

However, for the past decade much of the research and development
effort in the Just-in-Time compilation domain was focused on the
runtime compilation of statically typed languages, leaving an
important and steadily growing field of programming languages
behind: dynamically typed high level languages such as JavaScript,
Python, PHP and Ruby. Combined with an explosive growth of
web applications and the wide-spread use of dynamically typed
programming languages for the client and server side of such web
applications, this has created a situation where bytecode
interpretation is suddenly again the predominant mode of execution
for much of the code used on a daily basis on desktop computers,
including popular web programs and services like Google Mail or
Google Docs.

In this talk I will report on the design and development of
TraceMonkey, the JavaScript Just-in-Time compiler in Mozilla's Firefox
web browser. I will discuss the fundamental differences between
statically typed and dynamically typed languages from the
perspective of a compiler constructor, and I will highlight some
of the unique challenges for compiling dynamically typed languages
such as JavaScript.
