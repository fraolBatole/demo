Memory Management for Hard Real-time Systems

Abstract:
The Java programming language has become a viable platform
for real-time systems with applications in avionics, shipboard
computing, audio processing, industrial control and the
financial sector. High performance real-time Java virtual
machines (RT JVMs) are now available from multiple vendors.

One of the main challenges in using a high level programming
language, such as Java or C#, to program hard-real time
system is to deal with heap-allocated data structures. Traditional
techniques such as pre-allocation and object pooling are
ill-suited to modern software engineering practices. In this
talk I describe two approaches that we have experimented
with in the context of the Ovm real-time Java virtual machine:
region-based allocation and real-time garbage collection. I
will demonstrate that for tasks which can tolerate latencies
on the order of 1 millisecond real-time collectors are
perfectly adequate, but, in order to obtain sub-milliseconds
latencies other approaches are required.  The talk will
also give an overview of new results in non-blocking
concurrent garbage collection.
