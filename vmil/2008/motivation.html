<h2 class="bar">Motivation and Objectives</h2>
<p>
Modern programming languages are compiled to intermediate code preserving the
intention of high-level language constructs. Emerging modularization
mechanisms, however, lack such handling. Recent research results have shown
that deeper support for these modularization mechanisms, e.g., in virtual
machines and intermediate languages, is feasible; it allows applying tailored
optimizations and radically improves development processes such as incremental
compilation, debugging, etc.

The VMIL workshop, second in the series, is a forum for research in virtual
machines and intermediate languages with support for emerging modularization
mechanisms such as mix-ins, units, open classes, hyper-slices, adaptive
methods, roles, composition filters, layers, pointcuts-and-advice, and
inter-type declarations. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:
compilation-based and interpreter-based virtual machines as well as
intermediate language designs with dedicated support for emerging
modularization mechanisms, compilation techniques, optimization strategies,
improved techniques for fast predicate evaluation (e.g., of pointcuts) inside
virtual machines, and advanced caching and memory management schemes.
