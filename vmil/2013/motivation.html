<h2 class="bar">About the Workshop</h2>
<p>
The VMIL workshop is a forum for research in virtual machines and intermediate
languages. It is dedicated to identifying programming mechanisms and constructs
that are currently realized as code transformations or implemented in libraries
but should rather be supported at the VM level. 
Candidates for such mechanisms and
constructs include modularity mechanisms,
concurrency mechanisms, etc. 
Topics of interest include the investigation of which such
mechanisms are worthwhile candidates for integration with the run-time
environment, how said mechanisms can be elegantly (and reusably) expressed at
the intermediate language level (e.g., in bytecode), how their implementations
can be optimized, and how virtual machine architectures might be shaped to
facilitate such implementation efforts.
We especially welcome transformative ideas for virtual machines, 
including efficient support for game-changing IL mechanisms.
