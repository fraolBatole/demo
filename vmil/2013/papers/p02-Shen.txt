Title: Do Computer Programs Have to Be As Dumb As They Are?

Abstract:

Looking around this world, we see that a fledgling can fly faster and
faster, a pupil can calculate quicker and quicker, and a graduate
student can write papers better and better.  But since the birth of
computers, it has been the case that after the release of a software
package, the one millionth run of the program is typically not a bit
better than its first-time run. Do programs have to be this dumb? In
this talk, I will discuss the barriers that cause such dumbness, our
efforts in creating a more intelligent paradigm, and some open
challenges that you may be able to help address.
