Title: JavaScript as an Intermediate Language
By Shriram Krishnamurthi

Abstract: 

Numerous languages now compile to JavaScript, and its ubiquity in the
browser seems to make this inevitable. However, JavaScript appears to
be a medicore target for language deployment, erecting both obvious
and subtle obstacles. I will discuss some of these issues, especially
drawing on our experiences deploying Racket in the browser.
