Graduate student Rangeet Pan earned second place at the ACM Student Research Competition at 42nd International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE) 2020 for his work that shows that fixing certain bugs decreases the robustness of deep neural networks.  Rangeet Pan is a Ph.D. student supervised by Dr. Hridesh Rajan.

According to ACM, "The ACM Student Research Competition (SRC), sponsored by Microsoft, offers a unique forum for undergraduate and graduate students to present their original research before a panel of judges and attendees at well-known ACM-sponsored and co-sponsored conferences.

Recognizing the value of student participation at conferences, ACM started the program in 2003, but it is much more than just a travel funding program. The ACM SRC provides participants a chance to meet other students and to get direct feedback on their work from experts.

This year's competitions took place at 22 participating ACM SIG conferences, sponsored by SIGACCESS, SIGAI, SIGAPP, SIGARCH, SIGBED, SIGCHI, SIGCOMM, SIGCSE, SIGDA,SIGDOC, SIGGRAPH, SIGHPC,  SIGMICRO, SIGMOBILE, SIGMOD, SIGOPS, SIGPLAN,  SIGSOFT and SIGSPATIAL as well as Grace Hoppper and TAPIA and included more than 356 student participants."
