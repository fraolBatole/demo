    abstract = {
      In today's software-centric world, ultra-large-scale software repositories,
      such as SourceForge, GitHub, and Google Code, are the new library of
      Alexandria. They contain an enormous corpus of software and related
      information. Scientists and engineers alike are interested in analyzing this
      wealth of information. However, systematic extraction and analysis of relevant
      data from these repositories for testing hypotheses is hard, and best left for
      mining software repository (MSR) experts! Specifically, mining source code
      yields significant insights into software development artifacts and processes.
      Unfortunately, mining source code at a large scale remains a difficult task.
      Previous approaches had to either limit the scope of the projects studied,
      limit the scope of the mining task to be more coarse grained, or sacrifice
      studying the history of the code. In this article we address mining source
      code: (a) at a very large scale; (b) at a fine-grained level of detail; and
      (c) with full history information. To address these challenges, we present
      domain-specific language features for source-code mining in our language and
      infrastructure called Boa. The goal of Boa is to ease testing MSR-related
      hypotheses. Our evaluation demonstrates that Boa substantially reduces
      programming efforts, thus lowering the barrier to entry. We also show drastic
      improvements in scalability.
