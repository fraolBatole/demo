      Verifying that a parameterized system satisfies certain desired properties
      amounts to verifying an infinite family of the system instances. This problem
      is undecidable in general, and as such a number of sound and incomplete
      techniques have been proposed to address it. Existing techniques typically
      focus on parameterized systems with a single parameter, (i.e., on systems
      where the number of processes of exactly one type is dependent on the
      parameter); however, many systems in practice are multi-parameterized, where
      multiple parameters are used to specify the number of different types of
      processes in the system. In this work, we present an automatic verification
      technique for multi-parameterized systems, prove its soundness and show that
      it can be applied to systems irrespective of their communication topology. We
      present a prototype realization of our technique in our tool Golok, and
      demonstrate its practical applicability using a number of multi-parameterized
      systems.
