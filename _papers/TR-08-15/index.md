      Integrated systems are those where components must behave together in order to
      fulfill overall requirements. In such systems, modularization of integration
      relationships is important for enabling separate component compilation,
      testing, and debugging, and for enhanced reuse. Existing languages and
      approaches for modularizing integration relationships work, but do not solve
      all problems. In particular, they either do not completely decouple components
      or require workarounds, which at a minimum incurs design and performance
      overheads. In this work, we discuss instance-level quantified, typed events,
      which solve all of these problems. The technical contributions include: the
      design, semantics, and type system of instance-level quantified, typed events
      and a proof of its soundness. A formalized semantics is new to this paper, as
      there have been no previous formalizations of language features that aim to
      modularize separation of integration relationships. To demonstrate the
      feasibility of our language design, we have implemented this design in an
      interpreter. To provide an initial assessment of the language's benefits, we
      have implemented canonical examples in the literature. Our initial assessments
      show that instance-level quantified, typed events improve the separation of
      integration concerns over previous language design proposals.
