       In earlier work, we showed that the AspectJ notions of aspect and class can be
       unified in a new module construct that we called the classpect, and that this
       new model is simpler and able to accommodate a broader set of requirements for
       modular solutions to complex integration problems. We embodied our unified
       model in the Eos language design. The main contribution of this paper is a
       case study, which considers the implementation of the Gang-of-Four (GOF)
       design patterns in Eos to analyze the effect of new programming language
       constructs on these implementations. We also compare these implementations
       with the AspectJ's implementation. Our result shows that the Eos
       implementation showed improvement in 7 out of 23 design patterns, and are no
       worse in case of other 16 patterns. These improvements were mainly manifested
       in being able to realize the intent of the design patterns more clearly. The
       design structures realized in the Eos implementation provide supporting
       evidence for the potential benefits of the unified model.
