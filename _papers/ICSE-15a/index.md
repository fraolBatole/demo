      "Explicit concurrency should be abolished from all higher-level programming
      languages (i.e. everything except -perhaps- plain machine code.). Dijkstra [1]
      (paraphrased)." A promising class of concurrency abstractions replaces
      explicit concurrency mechanisms with a single linguistic mechanism that
      combines state and control and uses asynchronous messages for communications,
      e.g. active objects or actors, but that doesnâ€™t remove the hurdle of
      understanding non-local control transfer. What if the programming model
      enabled programmers to simply do what they do best, that is, to describe a
      system in terms of its modular structure and write sequential code to
      implement the operations of those modules and handles details of concurrency?
      In a recently sponsored NSF project we are developing such a model that we
      call capsule-oriented programming and its realization in the Panini project.
      This model favors modularity over explicit concurrency, forbids use of
      explicit threads and locks, encourages concurrency correctness by
      construction, and exploits modular structure of programs to expose implicit
      concurrency.
