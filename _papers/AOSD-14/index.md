      Aspect-oriented programming (AOP) is a popular technique for modularizing
      crosscutting concerns. In this context, researchers found that the realization
      of the design by contract (DbC) is cross- cutting and fares better when
      modularized by AOP. However, previous efforts aimed at supporting crosscutting
      contract modularly instead hindered it. For example, in AspectJ-style, to
      reason about the correctness of a method call may require a whole-program
      analysis to determine what advice applies and what that advice does in
      relation to DbC implementation and checking. Also, when contracts are
      separated from classes, a programmer may not know about them and break them
      inadvertantly. In this paper we solve these problems with AspectJML, a new
      language for specification of crosscutting contracts for Java code. We also
      show how AspectJML supports the main DbC principles of modular reasoning and
      contracts as documentation.
