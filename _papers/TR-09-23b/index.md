      Dynamic deployment is an important feature of an aspect-oriented language
      design that has many applications, e.g. in runtime monitoring, runtime
      adaptation to fix bugs or add features to long running applications, runtime
      update of dynamic policy changes, etc. Many recently proposed language designs
      support these use cases. In previous work, researchers have demonstrated that
      the ability to support unanticipated deployment enables simpler and often more
      efficient implementations. These works have addressed an important subset of
      aspect-oriented features namely those that can be represented as the
      pointcut-advice model. In this work, we describe the design, formal semantics,
      and implementation of our strategy for efficiently supporting dynamic
      deployment of inter-type declarations, which is another important
      aspect-oriented feature. Additional contributions of this work are: a detailed
      real world case study that demonstrates the need for supporting dynamic
      deployment of inter-type declaration for online update of long running
      applications, and a prototype based on the Jikes Virtual Machine that supports
      these features. We evaluate our prototype via a rigorous performance analysis,
      which shows that flexible, dynamic deployment of inter-type declarations can
      be efficiently supported in a JVM.
