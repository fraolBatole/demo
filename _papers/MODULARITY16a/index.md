      The need for concurrency in modern software is increasingly fulfilled by
      utilizing the message passing paradigm because of its modularity and
      scalability. In the message passing paradigm, concurrently running processes
      communicate by sending and receiving messages. Asynchronous messaging
      introduces the possibility of message ordering problems: two messages with a
      specific order in the program text could take effect in the opposite order in
      the program execution and lead to bugs that are hard to find and debug. We
      believe that the engineering of message passing software could be easier if
      more is known about the characteristics of message ordering problems in
      practice. In this work, we present an analysis to study and quantify the
      relation between ordering problems and semantics variations of their
      underlying message passing paradigm in over 30 applications. Some of our
      findings are as follows: (1) semantic variations of the message passing
      paradigm can cause ordering problems exhibited by applications in different
      programming patterns to vary greatly; (2) some semantic features such as
      in-order messaging are critical for reducing ordering problems; (3) modular
      enforcement of aliasing in terms of data isolation allows small test
      configurations to trigger the majority of ordering problems.
