      Aspect-oriented (AO) design and programming methods promise to improve the
      modularity properties of software-intensive systems. However, AO is also seen
      as violating fundamental design principles; and we lack a theory to guide its
      appropriate use. Our work rests on the idea that successful AO techniques have
      deep roots in implicit invocation (II) mechanisms. Elaborating this connection
      provides for an expedited development of both a theoretical understanding and
      an effective practice of AO design techniques. In this paper we show, in
      particular, that this bridge can be exploited to enable model checking of AO
      systems using existing techniques for II systems.
