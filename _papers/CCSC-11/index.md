      Integral to computer science education are computer organization and
      architecture courses. We present Frances-A, an engaging investigative tool
      that provides an environment for studying real assembly languages and
      architectures. Frances-A includes several features that enhance its usefulness
      in the classroom such as graphical relationships between high-level code and
      machine code, illustrated step by step machine state transitions, color coding
      to make instruction behavior clear, and illustration of pointers. Frances-A
      uses a simple web interface requiring no setup and is easy to use, making it
      easy to adopt in a course.
