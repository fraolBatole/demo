      Despite[1] their proven benefits, useful, comprehen- sible, and efficiently
      checkable specifications are not widely available. This is primarily because
      writing useful, non-trivial specifications from scratch is too hard, time
      consuming, and requires expertise that is not broadly available. Furthermore,
      the lack of specifications for widely-used libraries and frameworks, caused by
      the high cost of writing specifications, tends to have a snowball effect. Core
      libraries lack specifications, which makes specifying applications that use
      them expensive. To contain the skyrocketing development and maintenance costs
      of high assur- ance systems, this self-perpetuating cycle must be broken. The
      labor cost of specifying programs can be significantly decreased via advances
      in specification inference and synthesis, and this has been attempted several
      times, but with limited success. We believe that practical specification
      inference and synthesis is an idea whose time has come. Fundamental
      breakthroughs in this area can be achieved by leveraging the collective
      intelligence available in software artifacts from millions of open source
      projects. Fine- grained access to such data sets has been unprecedented, but
      is now easily available. We identify research directions and report our
      preliminary results on advances in specification inference that can be had by
      using such data sets to infer specifications.
