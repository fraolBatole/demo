      Implicit invocation (II) and aspect-oriented (AO) languages provide software
      designers with related but distinct mechanisms and strategies for decomposing
      programs into modules and composing modules into systems. II languages have
      explicitly announced events that run registered observer methods. AO languages
      have implicitly announced events that run method-like but more powerful
      advice. A limitation of II languages is their inability to refer to a large
      set of events succinctly. They also lack the expressive power of AO advice.
      Limitations of AO languages include potentially fragile dependence on
      syntactic structure that may hurt maintainability, and limits on the available
      set of implicit events and the reflective contextual information available.
      Quantified, typed events, as implemented in our language Ptolemy, solve all
      these problems. This paper describes Ptolemy and explores its advantages
      relative to both II and AO languages.
