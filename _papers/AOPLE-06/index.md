      As of today, it is unclear whether aspect-oriented modeling can benefit the
      model-driven development of software product lines. Although some preliminary
      studies exist at the requirements and implementation level that investigate
      the interaction of crosscutting behaviors and product-line variabilities, to
      the best of our knowledge these interactions at the modeling level are not yet
      investigated. The contribution of this work is a preliminary study of the
      object-oriented and aspect-oriented approaches for handling crosscutting
      variabilities. This study helps us identify desired characteristics of
      aspect-oriented modeling techniques for product lines. A pacemaker product
      line, extracted from the real industry case, serves as a running example to
      illustrate our findings.
