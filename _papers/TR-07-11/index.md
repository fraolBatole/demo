      The deployment scenarios for sensor networks are often hostile. These networks
      also have to operate unattended for long periods. Therefore, fault-tolerance
      mechanisms are needed to protect these networks from various faults such as
      node failure due to loss of power, compromise, etc and link failure due to
      network intrusion, etc. A number of fault-tolerance techniques have been
      developed specifically for wireless sensor networks. Verifying these
      fault-tolerant techniques is necessary for reliability and dependability
      checks. Formal methods such as model checking have been used for verification
      of such fault-tolerance mechanisms; however, building the models is a tedious
      job which makes model checking a hard task to accomplish. Techniques that
      allow model checking source code ease this task. These approaches automate the
      process of verification model construction. There are two aspects of automated
      verification model construction. First, a model of the application needs to be
      built. Second, a model of faults has to be created to expose problems with the
      application. In a previous work, we developed a framework, which we called
      Slede, to automatically extract PROMELA models from sensor network
      applications written in the nesC language. The contribution of this work is
      the design and implementation of a mechanism for automatically generating
      fault models from a partial specification of the application. By automatically
      generating fault models, our approach eases the verification of
      fault-tolerance for sensor network applications.
