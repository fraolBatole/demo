    abstract = {
      Aspect-oriented languages mostly employ implicit language-defined join point
      models, where well-defined points in the program are called join points and
      declarative predicates are used to quantify them. The primary motivation for
      using an implicit join point model is obliviousness and ease of
      quantification. A design choice for aspect-oriented intermediate languages is
      to mirror the source language model. In this position paper, I argue that an
      explicit join point model is better suited at the intermediate language level
      and sketch a preliminary solution.
