      Dynamic software updating provides many benefits, e.g. in runtime monitoring,
      runtime adaptation to fix bugs in long running applications, etc. Although it
      has several advantages, no quantitative analysis of its costs and revenue are
      available to show its benefits or limitations especially in comparison with
      other software updating schemes. To address this limitation in evaluating
      software updating schemes, we contribute a quantitative cost/benefit analysis
      based on net option-value model, which stems from the analysis of financial
      options. Our model expresses the relation between added value and paid cost in
      mathematical forms. We have used this model to evaluate the revenue from
      dynamic updating in two case studies featuring Xerces and MobileMedia. These
      studies reveal the set of parameter values that render dynamic updating
      effective. We also compared two previously published dynamic updating schemes
      and observed how the perceived performance and coverage of different updating
      systems affects their relative gain.
