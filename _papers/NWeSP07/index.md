      In a service oriented architecture, certain requirements can be tested by
      observing the interface of the service whereas other requirements such as data
      privacy, confidentiality and integrity cannot be tested in this way. After
      deployment, a requirements monitor is used to analyze the conformance of a web
      service to such requirements. The integrity of the reported conformance
      results is as good as of the integrity of the monitor especially when the
      requirements monitor is executing in an untrustworthy environment. In this
      paper, we propose a hardware-based dynamic attestation mechanism to validate
      the integrity of the requirements monitor. To evaluate our approach, we have
      conducted a case study using a commercial requirements monitor and a
      collection of web service implementations available with Apache Axis
      implementation. Our case study demonstrates the feasibility of verifying the
      conformance of a web service executing in an untrustworthy environment.
