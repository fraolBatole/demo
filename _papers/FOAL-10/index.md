      There is some consensus in the aspect-oriented community that a notion of
      interface between joinpoints and advice may be necessary for improved
      modularity of aspect-oriented programs, for modular reasoning, and for
      overcoming pointcut fragility. Different approaches for adding such
      interfaces, such as aspect-aware interfaces, pointcut interfaces, crosscutting
      interfaces, explicit joinpoints, quantified typed events, open modules, and
      joinpoint types decouple aspects and base code, enhancing modularity. However,
      existing work has not shown how one can write specifications for such
      interfaces that will actually allow modular reasoning when aspects and base
      code evolve independently, and that are capable of specifying control effects,
      such as when advice does not proceed. The main contribution of this work is a
      specification technique that allows programmers to write modular specification
      of such interfaces and that allows one to understand such control effects. We
      show that such specifications allow typical interaction patterns, and
      interesting control effects to be understood and enforced. We illustrate our
      techniques via an extension of Ptolemy, but we also show that our ideas can be
      applied in a straightforward manner to other notions of joinpoint interfaces,
      e.g. the crosscutting interfaces (XPIs).
