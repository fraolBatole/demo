      The Implicit Invocation (II) architectural style improves modularity and is
      promoted by aspect-oriented (AO) languages and design patterns like Observer.
      However, it makes modular reasoning difficult, especially when reasoning about
      control effects of the advised code (subject). Our language Ptolemy, which was
      inspired by II languages, uses translucid contracts for modular reasoning
      about the control effects; however, this reasoning relies on Ptolemy's event
      model, which has explicit event announcement and declared event types. In this
      paper we investigate how to apply translucid contracts to reasoning about
      events in other AO languages and even non-AO languages like C#.
