      The contribution of this work is the design, implementation, and early
      evaluation of a programming language that unifies classes and aspects. We call
      our new module construct the classpect. We make three basic claims. First, we
      can realize a unified design without significantly compromising the
      expressiveness of current aspect languages. Second, such a design improves the
      conceptual integrity of the programming model. Third, it significantly
      improves the compositionality of aspect modules, expanding the program design
      space from the two-layered model of AspectJ-like languages to include
      hierarchical structures. To support these claims, we present the design and
      implementation of Eos-U, an AspectJ-like language based on C# that supports
      classpects as the basic unit of modularity. We show that Eos-U supports
      layered designs in which classpects separate integration concerns flexibly at
      multiple levels of composition. The underpinnings of our design include
      support for aspect instantiation under program control, instance-level
      advising, advising as a general alternative to object-oriented method
      invocation and overriding, and the provision of a separate join-point-method
      binding construct.
