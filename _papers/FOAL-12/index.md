      Subtype polymorphism is an important feature available in most modern type
      systems which makes code reuse and specialization possible. Recent works on
      separation of crosscutting concerns have created event interfaces (types) to
      decouple subjects from handlers. Extending the notion of subtyping to these
      event interfaces is a logical step. In this paper, we define event type
      polymorphism in the context of the Ptolemy language. Ptolemy allows declaring
      quantified, typed events which provide an interface between subjects and
      handlers. We add the notion of polymorphic event types to the Ptolemy
      language, defining a subtype relation among event types which in turn allows
      for both depth and width subtyping with regard to event context. Since Ptolemy
      only has explicit event announcement, our semantics is simpler and easier to
      reason about when compared to previously defined approaches. We also give the
      first formally defined static semantics for polymorphic events as well as
      demonstrate its usefulness via examples.
