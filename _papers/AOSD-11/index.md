      As aspect-oriented programming techniques become more widely used, their use
      in critical systems, including safety-critical systems such as aircraft and
      mission-critical systems such as telephone networks, will become more
      widespread. However, careful reasoning about aspect-oriented code seems
      difficult with standard specification techniques. The difficulty stems from
      the difficulty of understanding control effects, such as advice that does not
      proceed to the original join point, because most common specification
      techniques do not make it convenient to specify such control effects. In this
      work we give a simple and understandable specification technique, which we
      call translucid contracts, that not only allows programmers to write modular
      specifications for advice and advised code, but also allows them to reason
      about the code's control effects. We show that translucid contracts support
      modular verification of typical interaction patterns used in aspect-oriented
      code. We also show that translucid contracts allow interesting control effects
      to be understood and enforced. Our proposed specification and verification
      approach is proved sound.
