      In earlier work, we showed that the AspectJ notions of aspect and class can be
      unified in a new module construct that we called the classpect, and that this
      new model is simpler and able to accommodate a broader set of requirements for
      modular solutions to complex integration problems. We embodied our unified
      model in the Eos language design. The main contribution of this paper is a
      case study, which considers the implementation of the Gang-of-Four (GOF)
      design patterns~\cite{gamma95a} in Eos to analyze the effect of new
      programming language constructs on these implementations. We also compare
      these implementations with the AspectJ's implementation. Our result shows that
      the Eos implementation showed improvement in 7 out of 23 design patterns, and
      are no worse in case of other 16 patterns. These improvements were mainly
      manifested in being able to realize the intent of the design patterns more
      clearly. The design structures realized in the Eos implementation provide
      supporting evidence for the potential benefits of the unified model.
