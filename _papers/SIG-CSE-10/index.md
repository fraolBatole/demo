      Compiler and programming language implementation courses are integral parts of
      many computer science curricula. However, the range of topics necessary to
      teach in such a course are difficult for students to understand and time
      consuming to cover. In particular, code generation is a confusing topic for
      students unfamiliar with low level target languages. We present Frances, a
      tool for helping students understand code generation and low level languages.
      The key idea is to graphically illustrate the relationships between high level
      language constructs and low level (assembly) language code. By illustrating
      these relationships, we take advantage of the students existing understanding
      of some high level language. We have used Frances in a compiler design course
      and received highly positive feedback. Students conveyed to us that Frances
      significantly helped them to understand the concepts necessary to implement
      code generation in a compiler project.
