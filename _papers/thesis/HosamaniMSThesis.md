      Services in a service-oriented architecture are designed to meet desired
      functional and non-functional requirements. Conformance of a service
      implementation to its functional requirements can be tested by observing the
      interface of the service but it is hard to enforce non-functional requirements
      such as data privacy and safety properties by monitoring the interface alone.
      Instead the implementation of the service need to be monitored for its
      conformance to the non-functional properties. A requirement's monitor can be
      deployed to check this conformance. A key problem is that such monitor must
      execute in an untrustworthy environment (at the service provider's location).;We
      argue that the integrity of the reported results of such a monitor crucially
      depends on the integrity of the monitor itself. Previous research results on
      trustworthy computing has shown that static properties, such as the checksum, of
      a remote program can be verified using a hardware-based mechanism called trusted
      platform module.;This thesis makes two contributions. First, we extend the
      traditional notion of a service-oriented architecture to accommodate the
      requirements for trust. Second, we propose a dynamic attestation mechanism that
      serves to support our extensions. To evaluate our approach, we have conducted a
      case study using a commercial requirements monitor and a collection of web
      service implementations available with Apache Axis implementation. Our case
      study demonstrates the feasibility of verifying the conformance of a web service
      executing in an untrusted environment with respect to a class of non-functional
      requirements using our approach. Lack of data privacy during online transactions
      is a major cause of concern among e-commerce users. By providing a technique to
      monitor such properties in a decoupled environment our work promises to address
      the issue of guaranteeing the privacy of confidential client data on the
      provider's side in a Service Oriented Architecture.
