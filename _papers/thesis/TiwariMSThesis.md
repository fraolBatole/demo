      We propose Candoia, a novel platform and ecosys- tem for building and sharing
      Mining Software Repositories (MSR) tools. Using Candoia, MSR tools are built as
      apps, and Candoia ecosystem, acting as an appstore, allows effective sharing.
      Candoia platform provides, data extraction tools for curating custom datasets
      for user projects, and data abstractions for enabling uniform access to MSR
      artifacts from disparate sources, which makes apps portable and adoptable across
      diverse software project settings of MSR researchers and practitioners. The
      structured design of a Candoia app and the languages selected for building
      various components of a Candoia app promotes easy customization. To evaluate
      Candoia we have built over two dozen MSR apps for analyzing bugs, software
      evolution, project management aspects, and source code and programming practices
      showing the applicability of the platform for building a variety of MSR apps.
      For testing portability of apps across diverse project settings, we tested the
      apps using ten popular project repositories, such as Apache Tomcat, JUnit,
      Node.js, etc, and found that apps required no changes to be portable. We
      performed a user study to test customizability and we found that five of eight
      Candoia users found it very easy to customize an existing app. Candoia is
      available for download.
