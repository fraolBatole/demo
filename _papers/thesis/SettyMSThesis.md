      Emerging modularization techniques such as aspects and their precursors such as
      events in implicit invocation languages aim to provide a software engineer with
      better facilities to separate conceptual concerns in software systems. To
      facilitate adoption of these techniques in real world software projects,
      seamless integration into well-accepted practices such as a test-driven
      development process is essential.  To that end, the main contribution of this
      thesis is an analysis (both pragmatic and theoretical) of the impact of a class
      of such techniques on the efficiency of a test-driven development process, which
      involves frequently compiling and testing programs in a process commonly known
      as the edit-compile- test cycle.  I study two variants:  the popular model of
      aspects as in the AspectJ-like languages, and a recently suggested alternative
      based on quantified, typed events embodied in the Ptolemy language. I present a
      case study analyzing two variants of the aspect-based model on two open source
      projects and a theoretical analysis of the quantified, typed event-based model.
      My results show that a seamless adoption of the aspect-based model requires
      careful balancing of competing parameters to ensure efficiency of a test-driven
      development process, whereas a quantified, typed event-based model naturally
      supports separate compilation thus decreasing the time spent in the
      edit-compile-test cycle.
