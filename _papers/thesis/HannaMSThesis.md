      Verifying sensor network security protocol implementations using
      testing/simulation might leave some flaws undetected. Formal verification
      techniques have been very successful in detecting faults in security protocol
      specifications; however, they generally require building a formal description
      (model) of the protocol. Building accurate models is hard, thus hindering the
      application of formal verification. In this work, a framework for automating
      formal verification of sensor network security protocols is presented. The
      framework Slede extracts models from protocol implementations and verifies them
      against generated intruder models. Slede was evaluated by verifying two sensor
      network security protocol implementations. Security flaws in both protocols were
      detected.
