      As aspect-oriented (AO) programming techniques become more widely used, their
      use in critical systems such as aircraft and telephone networks, will become
      more widespread. However, careful reasoning about AO code seems difficult
      because: (1) advice may apply in too many places, and (2) standard
      specification techniques do not limit the control effects of advice. Commonly
      used black box specification techniques cannot easily specify control effects,
      such as advice that does not proceed to the advised code. In this work we
      avoid the first problem by using Ptolemy, a language with explicit event
      announcement. To solve the second problem we give a simple and understandable
      specification technique, translucid contracts, that not only allows
      programmers to write modular specifications for advice and advised code, but
      also allows them to reason about the code's control effects. We show that
      translucid contracts support sound modular verification of typical interaction
      patterns used in AO code. We also show that translucid contracts allow
      interesting control effects to be specified and enforced.
