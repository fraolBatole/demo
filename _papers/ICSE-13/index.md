      In today's software-centric world, ultra-large-scale software repositories,
      e.g. SourceForge (350,000+ projects), GitHub (250,000+ projects), and Google
      Code (250,000+ projects) are the new library of Alexandria. They contain an
      enormous corpus of software and information about software. Scientists and
      engineers alike are interested in analyzing this wealth of information both
      for curiosity as well as for testing important hypotheses. However, systematic
      extraction of relevant data from these repositories and analysis of such data
      for testing hypotheses is hard, and best left for mining software repository
      (MSR) experts! The goal of Boa, a domain-specific language and infrastructure
      described here, is to ease testing MSR-related hypotheses. We have implemented
      Boa and provide a web-based interface to Boa's infrastructure. Our evaluation
      demonstrates that Boa significantly reduces programming efforts, thus lowering
      the barrier to entry. We also see drastic improvements in scalability. Last
      but not least, reproducing an experiment conducted using Boa is just a matter
      of re-running small Boa programs provided by previous researchers.
