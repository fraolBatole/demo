      Programming languages evolve over time, adding additional language features to
      simplify common tasks and make the language easier to use. For example, the
      Java Language Specification has four editions and is currently drafting a
      fifth. While the addition of language features is driven by an assumed need by
      the community (often with direct requests for such features), there is little
      empirical evidence demonstrating how these new features are adopted by
      developers once released. In this paper, we analyze over 31k open-source Java
      projects representing over 9 million Java files, which when parsed contain
      over 18 billion AST nodes. We analyze this corpus to find uses of new Java
      language features over time. Our study gives interesting insights, such as:
      there are millions of places features could potentially be used but weren't;
      developers convert existing code to use new features; and we found almost 200k
      instances of potential resource handling bugs.
