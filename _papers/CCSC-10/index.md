      Central to computing is machine code generation. Upper level undergraduate
      students studying computing are quite familiar with high-level languages. Most
      undergraduate programs in computing begin with a course involving computer
      programming in a high- level language and as students progress through their
      studies they gain more experience with high-level languages. Not only is the
      machine code central to upper level courses in computer science, introductory
      programming texts address the issue of how high-level languages are translated
      to execute on the machine [3, 4].
