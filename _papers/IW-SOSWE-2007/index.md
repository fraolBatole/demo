      The key notion in service-oriented architecture is decoupling clients and
      providers of a service based on an abstract service description, which is used
      by the service broker to point clients to a suitable service implementation. A
      client then sends service requests directly to the service implementation. A
      problem with the current architecture is that it does not provide trustworthy
      means for clients to specify, service brokers to verify, and service
      implementations to prove that certain desired non-functional properties are
      satisfied during service request processing. An example of such non-functional
      property is access and persistence restrictions on the data received as part
      of the service requests. In this work, we propose an extension of the
      service-oriented architecture that provides these facilities. We also discuss
      a prototype implementation of this architecture and report preliminary results
      that demonstrate the potential practical value of the proposed architecture in
      real-world software applications.
