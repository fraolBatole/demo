      Futures offer a convenient abstraction for encapsulating delayed computation.
      It is a mechanism to introduce concurrency through a rewrite of the sequential
      program. However, managing futures is tedious and requires knowledge of
      concurrency and its concerns. The notion of transparent futures is used to
      hide the complexity of futures from developers. A number of techniques based
      on transparency have been proposed to create and manage futures. Previous
      techniques make use of reflection. In this paper, we propose duck futures that
      use a generative approach. We show that duck futures are much more efficient
      compared to previous notions of transparent futures. We also present the first
      large scale study of the applicability and utility of duck futures in practice
      using the Boa infrastructure for mining large scale open source repositories.
      Our study finds that transparent futures, despite their limitations, can be
      very useful in practice.
