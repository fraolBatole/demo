       In todayâ€™s software-centric world, ultra-large-scale software repositories,
       e.g. SourceForge, GitHub, and Google Code, are the new library of Alexandria.
       They contain an enormous corpus of software and related information.
       Scientists and engineers alike are interested in analyzing this wealth of
       information. However, systematic extraction and analysis of relevant data from
       these repositories for testing hypotheses is hard, and best left for mining
       software repository (MSR) experts! Specifically, mining source code yields
       significant insights into software development artifacts and processes.
       Unfortunately, mining source code at a large-scale remains a difficult task.
       Previous approaches had to either limit the scope of the projects studied,
       limit the scope of the mining task to be more coarse-grained, or sacrifice
       studying the history of the code. In this paper we address mining source code:
       a) at a very large scale; b) at a fine-grained level of detail; and c) with
       full history information. To address these challenges, we present
       domain-specific language features for source code mining in our language and
       infrastructure called Boa. The goal of Boa is to ease testing MSR-related
       hypotheses. Our evaluation demonstrates that Boa substantially reduces
       programming efforts, thus lowering the barrier to entry. We also show drastic
       improvements in scalability.
