      A variety of language features to modularize crosscutting concerns have
      recently been discussed, e.g. open modules, annotation-based pointcuts,
      explicit join points, and quantified-typed events. All of these ideas are
      essentially a form of aspect-oriented interface between object-oriented and
      crosscutting modules, but the representation of this interface differs.
      Previous works have studied maintenance benefits of AO programs compared to OO
      programs, by usually looking at a single AO interface. Other works have looked
      at several AO interfaces, but only on relatively small systems or systems with
      only one type of aspectual behavior. Thus there is a need for a study that
      examines large, realistic systems for several AO interfaces to determine what
      problems arise and in which interface(s). The main contribution of this work
      is a rigorous empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of these
      proposals for 4 different AO interfaces by applying them to 35 different
      releases of a software product line called MobileMedia and 50 different
      releases of a web application called Health Watcher. In total over 400k lines
      of code were studied across all releases. Our comparative analysis using
      quantitative metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer shows the strengths and
      weaknesses of these AO interface proposals. Our change impact analysis shows
      the design stability provided by each of these recent proposals for AO
      interfaces.
