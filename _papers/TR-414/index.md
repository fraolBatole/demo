      The contribution of this work is the design, implementation and evaluation of
      a new aspect-oriented invocation mechanism for preserving design modularity in
      object code. We call our mechanism Bind. We make three basic claims. First, it
      is feasible to realize a programming model that supports Bind to preserve
      design modularity in object code. Second, the new invocation mechanism further
      improves the conceptual integrity of the aspect-oriented programming models by
      allowing advising and runtime properties of aspect-like constructs to be
      modeled as simple combinations of invocation primitives as opposed to new
      language constructs. Third, it brings new possibility for structuring
      aspect-oriented systems, removing the commitment to a single aspect-language
      model, and expanding the program design space to include arbitrary
      combinations of language models and advising structures. To support these
      claims, we present the design and implementation of Nu, a programming model
      based on the .NET Framework that supports Bind as an invocation mechanism. We
      show that Nu supports aspect-oriented program designs where multiple
      aspect-language models can be emulated using Bind, and used in arbitrary
      combinations without compromising the design modularity in the object code.
