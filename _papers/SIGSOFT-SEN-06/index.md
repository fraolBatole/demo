      The semantic gap between specification and implementation languages for sensor
      networks security protocols impedes the specification and verification of the
      protocols. In this work, we present SLEDE, an event-based specification
      language and its verifying compiler that address this semantic gap. We
      demonstrate the features of SLEDE through an example specification of the
      Î¼Tesla, secure broadcast protocol for sensor networks.
