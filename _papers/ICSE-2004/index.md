      Component integration creates value by automating the costly and error-prone
      task of imposing desired behavioral relationships on components manually.
      Requirements for component integration, however, complicate software design
      and evolution in several ways: first, they lead to coupling among components;
      second, the code that implements various integration concerns in a system is
      often scattered over and tangled with the code implementing the component
      behaviors. Straightforward software design techniques map integration
      requirements to scattered and tangled code, compromising modularity in ways
      that dramatically increase development and maintenance costs.
