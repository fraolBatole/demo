      Students in all areas of computing require knowledge of the computing device
      including software implementation at the machine level. Several courses in
      computer science curricula address these low-level details such as computer
      architecture and assembly languages. For such courses, there are advantages to
      studying real architectures instead of simplified examples. However, real
      architectures and instruction sets introduce complexity that makes them
      difficult to grasp in a single semester course. Visualization techniques can
      help ease this burden, unfortunately existing tools are often difficult to use
      and consequently difficult to adopt in a course where time is already limited.

      To solve this problem, we present Frances. Frances graphically illustrates key
      differences between familiar high-level languages and unfamiliar low-level
      languages and also illustrates how familiar high-level programs behave on real
      architectures. Key to this tool is that we use a simple web interface that
      requires no setup, easing course adoption hurdles. We also include several
      features that further enhance its usefulness in a classroom setting. These
      features include graphical relationships between high-level code and machine
      code, clearly illustrated step by step machine state transitions, color coding
      to make instruction behavior clear, and illustration of pointers.

      We have used Frances in courses and performed experimental evaluation. Our
      experiences with Frances in the classroom demonstrate its usability. Most
      notably, in our experimental setting, students with no computer architecture
      course experience were able to complete lessons using Frances with no
      guidance.
