      The contribution of this work is the design and evaluation of a programming
      language model that unifies aspects and classes, as they appear in
      AspectJ-like languages. We show that our model preserves the capabilities of
      AspectJ-like languages, while improving the conceptual integrity of the
      language model and the compositionality of modules. The improvement in
      conceptual integrity is manifested by the reduction of specialized constructs
      in favor of uniform orthogonal constructs. The enhancement in compositionality
      is demonstrated by better modularization of integration and higher-order
      crosscutting concerns.
