      Separating crosscutting concerns while preserving modular reasoning is
      challenging. Type-based interfaces (event types) separate modularized
      crosscutting concerns (observers) and traditional object-oriented concerns
      (subjects). Event types paired with event specifications were shown to be
      effective in enabling modular reasoning about subjects and observers. Similar
      to class subtyping, organizing event types into subtyping hierarchies is
      beneficial. However, unrelated behaviors of observers and their arbitrary
      execution orders could cause unique, somewhat counterintuitive, reasoning
      challenges in the presence of event subtyping. These challenges threaten both
      tractability of reasoning and reuse of event types. This work makes three
      contributions. First, we pose and explain these challenges. Second, we propose
      an event-based calculus to show how these challenges can be overcome. Finally,
      we present modular reasoning rules of our technique and show its applicability
      to other event-based techniques.
