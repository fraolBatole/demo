      This paper makes two contributions: a generalization of AspectJ-like languages
      with first-class aspect instances and instance-level advising, and a mapping
      of the mediator style for integrated system design into this space. We present
      Eos as a prototype language design and implementation. It extends C# with
      AspectJ-like constructs, first-class aspect instances and instance-level
      advising. These features enable a direct mapping of mediators to aspect
      instances, with modularity improved, insofar as components need not declare,
      announce, or register for events.
