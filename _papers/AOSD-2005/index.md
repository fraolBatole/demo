      In program profiling to assess test set adequacy, a challenge is to select
      code to be included in the assessment. Current mechanisms are coarse-grained;
      biased to dominant modularizations; require tedious, error-prone manual
      selection; and leave tester intent implicit in inputs to testing tools.
      Aspect-oriented constructs promise to improving testing in two ways: by
      improving our ability to select the code to include in adequacy criteria, and
      by documenting selection intentions in declarative form in the code itself.
      One problem is that current join point models do not reveal program behavior
      in enough detail to support white-box coverage analysis. Our contribution is
      the formulation, prototyping, and evaluation of a language-and-tool-based
      approach to white-box coverage adequacy analysis that we call concern
      coverage. We develop and evaluate one instance of the general idea in which
      branches, in particular, are exposed as join points to support branch coverage
      analysis of crosscutting concerns. Our results are consistent with the claim
      that the idea has the potential to improve test coverage analysis.
