      The popularity of Python programming language has surged in recent years due to
      its increasing usage in Data Science. The availability of Python repositories in
      Github presents an opportunity for mining software repository research, e.g.,
      suggesting the best practices in developing Data Science applications, identifying
      bug-patterns, recommending code enhancements, etc. To enable this research, we have
      created a new dataset that includes 1,558 mature Github projects that develop Python
      software for Data Science tasks. By analyzing the metadata and code, we have included
      the projects in our dataset which use a diverse set of machine learning libraries and
      managed by a variety of users and organizations. The dataset is made publicly available
      through Boa infrastructure both as a collection of raw projects as well as in a
      processed form that could be used for performing large scale analysis using Boa language.
      We also present two initial applications to demonstrate the potential of the dataset
      that could be leveraged by the community.
