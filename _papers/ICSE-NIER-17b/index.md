      API documentation is useful for developers to better understand how to correctly
      use the libraries. However, not all libraries provide good documentation on API
      usages. To provide better documentation, existing techniques have been proposed
      including program analysis-based and data mining-based approaches. In this work,
      instead of mining, we aim to generate behavioral exception documentation for any
      given code. We treat the problem of automatically generating documentation from
      a novel perspective: statistical machine translation (SMT). We consider the
      documentation and source code for an API method as the two abstraction levels of
      the same intention. We use SMT to translate documentation from source code and
      vice versa. Our preliminary results show that the direction of statistical
      learning for inference between implementations and documentation is very
      promising.
