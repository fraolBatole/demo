      Improved separation of concern is important for dealing with increasing
      complexity of today's software systems. A number of language designs have been
      proposed in the last decade with the common goal to improve the separation of
      concerns by providing better modularization mechanisms e.g. mixins, units,
      roles, layers, hyperspaces, events, aspects, etc. To understand the benefits of
      a new modularization mechanism, it is important to apply it to real world large
      scale software systems, where there are real needs for separation of concerns.
      However, large scale software projects are generally managed very cautiously and
      adoption of a new technique in these projects is generally harder to achieve.
      Typically such adoption is driven by demonstrated success of the technique in
      other large scale projects, a catch-22 situation. In this position paper, I
      discuss a software repository mining-based technique to achieve the effect of
      adoption in a large scale software project in a controlled setting. Rich change
      history available in the version control systems for open source software
      projects, and advances in software repository mining enable this technique for
      empirical evaluation of a modularization mechanism.
