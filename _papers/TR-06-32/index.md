      Quantification is a distinguishing characteristic of AspectJ-like
      aspect-oriented languages. Such languages use advice constructs to modify the
      behavior of execution points. In this work, we contribute an approach and a
      language de- sign for quantification based on type hierarchies that we call
      type-based quantification. The key idea is to superimpose a crosscutting type
      hierarchy over the ob ject-oriented inheri- tance hierarchy. This crosscutting
      type hierarchy can then be utilized for quantification, instead of or in
      addition to current syntactic quantification mechanisms based on regu- lar
      expressions. A subsequent evaluation reveals that type- based quantification
      improves the robustness of the advising code against base code changes, and
      makes it easier for the advice constructs to uniformly access contextual
      information about the join point without breaking the encapsulation of the
      advised code.
