      Researchers use shared computing clusters to ask interesting questions and
      wish to maximize their utilization. Currently, optimizations focus on
      individual programs. We present task fusion to automatically merge multiple
      tasks into a single task. An example implementation shows fused tasks take
      14-90% less time than running the tasks individually.
