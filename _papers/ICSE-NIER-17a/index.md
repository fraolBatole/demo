      Ultra-large-scale mining has been shown to be useful for a number of
      software engineering tasks e.g. mining specifications, defect prediction.
      We propose a new research direction for accelerating ultra-large-scale
      mining that goes beyond parallelization. Our key idea is to analyze the
      interaction pattern between the mining task and the artifact to cluster
      artifacts such that running the mining task on one candidate artifact from
      each cluster is sufficient to produce results for other artifacts in the
      same cluster. Our artifact clustering criteria go beyond syntactic, semantic,
      and functional similarities to mining-task-specific similarity, where the
      interaction pattern between the mining task and the artifact is used for
      clustering. Our preliminary evaluation demonstrates that our technique
      significantly reduces the overall mining time.
