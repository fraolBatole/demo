      A variety of language features to modularize crosscutting concerns have
      recently been discussed, e.g. open modules, annotation-based pointcuts,
      explicit join points, and quantified-typed events. All of these ideas are
      essentially a form of aspect-oriented interface between object-oriented and
      crosscutting modules, but the representation of this interface differs. While
      previous works have studied maintenance of AO programs versus OO programs, an
      empirical comparison of different AO interfaces to each other to investigate
      their benefits has not been performed. The main contribution of this work is a
      rigorous empirical study that evaluates the effectiveness of these proposals
      for AO interfaces towards software maintenance by applying them to 35
      different releases of a software product line called MobileMedia and 50
      different releases of a web application called Health Watcher. Our comparative
      analysis using quantitative metrics proposed by Chidamber and Kemerer shows
      the strengths and weaknesses of these AO interface proposals. Our change
      impact analysis shows the design stability provided by each of these recent
      proposals for AO interfaces.
