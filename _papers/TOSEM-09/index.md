      The emergence of aspect-oriented programming (AOP) languages has provided
      software designers with new mechanisms and strategies for decomposing programs
      into modules and composing modules into systems. What we do not yet fully
      understand is how best to use such mechanisms consistent with common
      modularization objectives such as the comprehensibility of programming code,
      its parallel development, dependability, and ease of change. The main
      contribution of this work is a new form of information hiding interface for
      AOP that we call the crosscut programming interface, or XPI. XPIs abstract
      crosscutting behaviors and make these abstractions explicit. XPIs can be used,
      albeit with limited enforcement of interface rules, with existing AOP
      languages, such as AspectJ. To evaluate our notion of XPIs, we have applied
      our XPI-based design methodology to a medium-sized network overlay application
      called Hypercast. A qualitative and quantitative analysis of existing AO
      design methods and XPI-based design method shows that our approach produces
      improvements in program comprehensibility, in opportunities for parallel
      development, and in the ease with which code can be developed and changed.
