    abstract = {
      For a number of reasons, such as to generate object code that is compliant
      with the existing virtual machines (VM), current compilers for aspect-oriented
      languages sacrifice design modularity when transforming source to object code
      by losing textual locality and intermingling concerns in the object code.
      Sacrificing design modularity has significant costs, especially in terms of
      the speed of incremental compilation. We present an intermediate language
      design that preserves aspect-oriented design modularity in Java byte code. We
      briefly describe our extensions to the Sun Hotspot VM to support the new
      intermediate language design.
