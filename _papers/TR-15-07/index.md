      In earlier work, we showed that the AspectJ notions of aspect and class can be
      unified in a new module construct that we called the classpect, and that this
      new model is simpler and able to accommodate a broader set of requirements for
      modular solutions to complex integration problems. We embodied our unified
      model in the Eos language design. The main contribution of this article is a
      case study, which considers the implementation of the Gang-of-Four (GOF)
      design patterns in Eos to analyze the effect of new programming language
      constructs on these implementations. We also compare these implementations
      with the AspectJ's implementation. Our result shows that the Eos
      implementation showed improvement in 7 out of 23 design patterns, and are no
      worse in case of other 16 patterns. These improvements were mainly manifested
      in being able to realize the intent of the design patterns more clearly. The
      design structures realized in the Eos implementation provide supporting
      evidence for the potential benefits of the unified model.
