      Modern software systems are increasingly including machine learning (ML) as 
      an integral component. However, we do not yet understand the difficulties 
      faced by software developers when learning about ML libraries and using them 
      within their systems. To that end, this work reports on a detailed (manual) 
      examination of 3,280 highly-rated posts related to ten ML libraries, 
      namely Tensorflow, Keras, Scikit-learn, Weka, Caffe, Theano, MLLib, Torch, 
      Apache Mahout, and H2O, on Stack Overflow, a popular online technical Q and A forum. We classify 
      these questions into seven typical stages of an ML pipeline to understand the 
      correlation between the library and the stage. We also perform inter- and 
      intra-library analyses to understand broad trends. Our findings reveal the urgent 
      need for software engineering (SE) research in this area. Both static and dynamic 
      analyses are mostly absent and badly needed to help developers find errors 
      earlier. While there has been some early research on debugging, much more work is 
      needed. API misuses are prevalent and API design improvements are sorely 
      needed. Enabling reuse of trained models across libraries needs attention. 
      Last and somewhat surprisingly, a tug of war between providing higher levels 
      of abstractions and the need to understand the behavior of the trained model 
      is prevalent. These findings suggest new paths for SE researchers to help 
      improve the engineering of software that includes ML components.
