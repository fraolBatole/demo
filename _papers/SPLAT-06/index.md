      Today’s aspect-oriented programming (AOP) languages provide software engineers
      with new possibilities for keeping conceptual concerns separate at the source
      code level. For a number of reasons, aspect weavers sacriﬁce this separation
      in transforming source to object code (and thus the very term weaving). In
      this paper, we argue that sacriﬁcing modularity has signiﬁcant costs,
      especially in terms of the speed of incremental compilation and in testing. We
      argue that design modularity can be preserved through the mapping to object
      code, and that preserving it can have signiﬁcant beneﬁts in these dimensions.
      We present and evaluate a mechanism for preserving design modularity in object
      code, showing that doing so has potentially signiﬁcant benefits.
