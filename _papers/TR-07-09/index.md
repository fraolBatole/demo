      Sensor networks are often deployed in hostile situations. A number of
      protocols are being developed to secure these networks. Current means to
      verify these protocols include simulation, manual inspection, and running them
      on sensor network testbeds. These techniques leave room for subtle errors in
      protocol implementations that can be exploited by adversaries. The
      contribution of this work is the design, implementation and early evaluation
      of a domain-specific verification framework for nesC implementations of sensor
      network security protocols. We call our verification framework Slede.
      Technical underpinnings of Slede include support for automatic extraction of
      PROMELA models from nesC source code, an annotation language to guide the
      verification process, and an automatic intrusion model generator. Preliminary
      evaluation shows that Slede was able to discover flaws in a canonical
      cryptographic protocol by Needham and Schroeder and two security protocols
      specific to sensor networks. We also demonstrate that a protocol aware
      intrusion model automatically generated by Slede incurs a small extra cost
      compared to models handwritten by model checking experts. By automating a
      significant portion of the verification process, Slede promises to make it
      easier to apply finite-state model checking to verify nesC protocol
      implementations.
