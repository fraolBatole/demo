      Aspect-oriented programming languages such as AspectJ offer new mechanisms for
      decomposing systems into modules and composing modules into systems. Common
      ways of using these mechanisms couple aspects to complex, changeable
      implementation details, which can compromise modularity. The crosscut
      programming interface (XPI) can significantly improve modularity in the design
      of programs employing AspectJ-style AOP. The use of XPIs doesn't limit the use
      of existing AOP mechanisms or require new ones, and the approach appears to
      generalize to other languages.This article is part of a special issue on
      aspect-oriented programming.
