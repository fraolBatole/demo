      In previous work, Rajan and Leavens presented the design of Ptolemy,
      a language which incorporates the notion of quantified, typed events for
      improved separation of concerns. In this work, we present an empirical study
      to evaluate the effectiveness of Ptolemy's design by applying it to a series
      of architectural releases of a software product line (SPL) for handling
      multimedia on mobile devices, called MobileMedia, and the comparison and
      contrast of our findings with a previous in-depth analysis by Figueiredo et
      al of the object-oriented and aspect-oriented designs of the same system. Our
      comparative analysis using quantitative metrics proposed by Chidambar and
      Kemerer (and subsequently used by Garcia et al) and a net-options value
      analysis used earlier by Cai, Sullivan and Lopes shows that quantified, typed
      events significantly improve the separation of concerns and further decouple
      components in the MobileMedia design.
