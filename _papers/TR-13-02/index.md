      Programming languages evolve over time, adding additional language features to
      simplify common tasks and make the language easier to use. For example, the Java
      Language Specification has four editions and is currently drafting a fifth.
      While the addition of language features is driven by an assumed need by the
      community (often with direct requests for such features), there is little
      empirical evidence demonstrating how these new features are adopted by
      developers once released. In this paper, we analyze over 23k open-source Java
      projects representing over 7 million Java files, which when parsed contain over
      14 billion AST nodes. We analyze this corpus to find uses of new Java language
      features over time. Our study gives interesting insights, such as: the fact that
      while all features are used, there are still millions of more places they could
      potentially be used; all features are used before release; and features tend to
      be adopted by committers on an individual basis rather than as a team.
