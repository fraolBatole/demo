Experimentation is always the best way to learn. You might also want to follow 
  the Eos tutorial. Tutorial gives you basic overview of the language and it 
  takes you through the examples provided with this package. Tutorial is intended 
  for readers who know the basic constructs of the C# language as Eos is an 
  aspect-oriented extension of C#. Some of the terminology and concepts related 
  to aspect-oriented programming are also discussed in the tutorial. In case of 
  any doubts, problems, suggestions please do not hesitate to contact the Eos 
  team at Eos@cs.virginia.edu.

Eos requires .NET framework. This Framework can be obtained from various 
  sources, but Eos is only tested on Microsoft&reg; .NET Framework version 1.0.3705. 
  You are free to try it on other frameworks and we will be happy to know the 
  results and help you out in case you encounter errors.

    specify many options available with C# compiler. All options were added on 
    a need basis. If you need some specific option available in C# compiler csc.exe 
    for your project, please let us know and we will try our best to provide it, 
    however we do not offer any guarantee that it will be provided.</li>
