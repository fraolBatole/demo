His best known work in the area is on Eos
(see <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~eos/">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~eos/</a>)
with Professor <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan">Kevin J. Sullivan</a>,
an aspect-oriented extension of C# that unifies aspect-and object-oriented
programming language.
His recent work on Nu (see <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~nu/">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~nu/</a>)
with Robert Dyer and Rakesh Setty is developing a novel aspect-oriented intermediate language design 
to preserve design modularity in object code for efficient separate and incremental compilation
and dynamic adaptation of aspect-oriented programs.
His work on Sapha (see <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/projects/multicore/">
http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/projects/multicore/</a>) 
is designing, implementing and evaluating program analysis-based 
automatic thread-to-core assignment techniques for heterogeneous 
multi-core processors that will enhance the utilization of these 
processors. 
His work on Tisa (see <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~tisa">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~tisa/</a>) with 
Mahantesh Hosamani, Harish Narayanappa, Robert Dyer, and 
John Altidor) explores more efficient techniques for enforcing 
trust and security properties in truly decoupled architectures 
such as web services. 
His work on Slede (see <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~slede">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~slede/</a>)
with Youssef Hanna and Wensheng Zhang aims to improve the reliability
of wireless sensor networks by formally specifying and verifying security
protocols designed for them.

<h2>Academic Background</h2>
<p></p>
<p>
My advisor at <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> 
was <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan">Kevin Sullivan</a>, whose
advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/notkin/">David Notkin</a>.
My <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/xie/sefamily.htm">academic genealogy</a>
goes all the way to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD">Edsger Dijkstra.</a>
</p>

<p>
In prior life, I worked at <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com">Bell Labs</a> India,
the R&amp;D organization of <a href="http://www.lucent.com">Lucent Technologies</a>.
At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile
ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.
</p>

<h2>Personal</h2>

<p>
I come from a small town called Mokama in <a href="http://gov.bih.nic.in/Profile/history.htm">Bihar</a>, 
<a href="http://indiaimage.nic.in/">India</a>. I have had the pleasure to live within 
50ft from the river Ganga, a major river in India, for most of my childhood. 
If you are from Mokama, I will be glad to hear from you. Send me an e-mail and
we can share stories :-).
</p>

<p>
Beside computer science, I love
<a href="http://virginiasports.collegesports.com/sports/m-footbl/va-m-footbl-body.html">
cavaliers</a> (trying to grow into <a href="http://www.cyclones.com/">cyclones</a>),
<a href="http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/">Dreamworks Animation Movies</a>,
driving, racquet ball, paintball, chess, and pool (not necessarily in this order).
Sometimes, I also pretend to be a handyman.
</p>

<h2>Etc,etc</h2>

<p>A friend of mine who shall remain nameless writes comic strips 
about online matrimonials <a href="http://www.shaadicomics.com">
www.shaadicomics.com</a>. His comic strips are quite funny.</p>

<p>Another colleague and long-time friend runs this job web-site
geared towards <a href="http://www.iimjobs.com">MBA jobs</a>
for IIM graduates. I find this forum particularly effective.</p>
