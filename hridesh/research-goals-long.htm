<h2> Research Theme and Goals</h2>
<p>
Increasing software complexity demands means to
cope with it so that we can build intellectually manageable systems.
Separation of concerns is one such method.
In practice, a good separation of concern
is achieved by finding the right decomposition or modularization of a
problem. Invention and refinement of new modularization techniques is
thus becoming more important with the growing complexity of software
systems. I research modularization techniques with the overarching goal
of improving the reliability, maintainability, and evolvability of
software systems and the efficiency of software development processes.
To that end, I have investigated modularity and module systems in the
context of <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>,
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~nu">Nu</a>, and
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~eos">Eos</a> projects.
In the Ptolemy project, we have investigated the fragility and
modular reasoning problems with aspect-oriented programming
and show how to fix it.
An <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/papers/ECOOP-2008/">ECOOP'08</a>
paper describes it in detail. The Ptolemy language combines flexibility and
expressiveness desired from AO languages with safety and modular reasoning
typically expected from module systems.
The goals of the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~nu">Nu</a> project
are to maintain design-level modularity in the intermediate code for
improved scalability of development processes.

I am also investigating implications of modularity on verification processes.
In the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~tisa">Tisa</a> project,
we are developing reasoning techniques for web-services
that allow more expressive temporal assertions to be validated
without sacrificing modularity (see our
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/papers/ESOP-2009">ESOP'09</a>
paper about Tisa).
In the context of the
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~slede">Slede</a> project,
we are exploiting modular reasoning about a homogeneous
process in a parameterized system to automate finding cut-off
value for this process (see our
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/papers/ESEC-FSE-09">ESEC/FSE'09</a>
paper).

<p>If you had time to read just one paper, I would recommend reading
the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~design/papers/ECOOP-2008/">ECOOP'08</a> paper on
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~ptolemy">Ptolemy</a>.</p>
