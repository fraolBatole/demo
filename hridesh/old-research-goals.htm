<p class="heading"> Research Theme and Goals</p>
<p>
My research aims to improve software quality and programmer productivity 
by development and refinement of modularization techniques. 
I have contributed to design, semantics, and implementation of 
aspect-oriented language features, where my main goal has been to 
improve the regularity, orthogonality, and conceptual integrity of 
aspect language features 
(see the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~eos/">Eos</a> and 
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~nu/">Nu</a> projects for details). 
I have also contributed to improving modular reasoning about 
aspect-oriented programs 
(see the <a href="http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu">Ptolemy</a> 
project for details).

<p>
Most of my current efforts are directed towards the design, semantics, 
and implementation of 
<a href="http://paninij.org">
the Panini language</a>. 
The main goal of Panini's design is to address problems
with explicit concurrency features such as data races, deadlocks 
and non-deterministic semantics. 
Key idea is to design programming language features 
and software design practices that exploit 
common interaction patterns available in good, modular software 
design to expose potential concurrency implicitly and safely. 
In that sense, Panini's design reconciles modularity and 
concurrency goals.
