<p class="heading">Official Biographical Sketch</p>
<p>
Hridesh Rajan is a professor and interim department chair
of computer science at Iowa State University,
where he has been since 2005.
Professor Rajan earned his MS and Ph.D. from the University of Virginia
in 2004 and 2005 respectively.
Prof. Rajan's research interests are
in programming languages, software engineering, and data science where he is most known
for his design of the <a href="http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu">Ptolemy</a>
programming language that showed how to
modularly reason about crosscutting concerns and the
<a href="http://boa.cs.iastate.edu">Boa</a> programming
language and its infrastructure that decreases the barriers to
data-driven software engineering.
Professor Rajanâ€™s recent research and educational activities are aimed at
decreasing the barrier to entry to data-driven sciences to broaden participation.
His work on the Boa project is aimed at invention and refinement of
cyberinfrastructures that democratize data-driven science.
His work on the Midwest Big Data Summer School is experimenting with broadly
accessible data science curricula.
Professor Rajan is the founding general chair of the annual
<a href="http://mbds.cs.iastate.edu">Midwest Big Data Summer School</a>,
and the founder of the <a href="https://2018.splashcon.org/series/vmil">VMIL workshop series</a>.

<p class="heading">Academic Background</p>
<p>
My advisor at <a href="http://www.virginia.edu">University of Virginia</a> 
was <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~sullivan">Kevin Sullivan</a>, whose
advisor was <a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/notkin/">David Notkin</a>.
My <a href="http://www.csc.ncsu.edu/faculty/xie/sefamily.htm">academic genealogy</a>
goes all the way to <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD">Edsger Dijkstra.</a>
</p>

<p>
In prior life, I worked at <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com">Bell Labs</a> India,
the R&amp;D organization of <a href="http://www.lucent.com">Lucent Technologies</a>.
At the time, I was interested in bandwidth and power optimization issues in mobile
ad hoc & sensor networks as they scale up. I still keep up with these topics.

<p class="heading">Personal</p>
<p>
I come from a small town called Mokama in <a href="http://gov.bih.nic.in/Profile/history.htm">Bihar</a>, 
<a href="http://indiaimage.nic.in/">India</a>. I have had the pleasure to live within 
50ft from the river Ganga, a major river in India, for most of my childhood. 
If you are from Mokama, I will be glad to hear from you. Send me an e-mail and
we can share stories :-).
</p>

<p>
Beside computer science, I love
<a href="http://virginiasports.collegesports.com/sports/m-footbl/va-m-footbl-body.html">
cavaliers</a> and <a href="http://www.cyclones.com/">cyclones</a>,
<a href="http://www.dreamworksanimation.com/">Dreamworks Animation Movies</a>,
driving, and golf (not necessarily in this order).
I also enjoy restoration work.
