  "Of all the monsters that fill the nightmares of our folklore, none terrify more than werewolves, because they 
   transform unexpectedly from the familiar into horrors. For these, on seeks bullets of silver that can 
   magically lay them to rest" ~ From "<A href="http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=26441&dl=ACM&coll=portal">No Silver Bullet - Essence and Accidents of Software Engineering</A>" by 
   Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. <BR> <BR>

  "Twenty years from now you will be more disappointed by the things that you didn't do than by the ones you did do. 
   So throw off the bowlines. Sail away from the safe harbor. Catch the trade winds in your sails. Explore. Dream. 
   Discover." ~Mark Twain <BR>
