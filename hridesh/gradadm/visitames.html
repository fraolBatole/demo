<h3>Visiting Ames</h3>
<p><br>
<font color="#800000"><strong><big><big>Transportation</big></strong></big></font><br>
<br>
You can reach Ames by flying to Des Moines, Iowa (about 28 miles south of Ames on
Interstate 35). Des Moines is served by most major Midwest carriers, including: Access
Air, America West Express, American Airlines, American Eagle, Chicago Express, Comair,
Mesaba Airlines, Northwest Airlines, TWA, US Air Express, and United Airlines. (See the
Des Moines airport web page at
<a href="http://www.dsmairport.com/" target="new">www.dsmairport.com</a>
for phone numbers and flight information.)</p>

<p>After arriving in Des Moines, you can travel to Ames via a rental car (Avis, Budget, Hertz,
and National) at the airport (see the airport web page for details), or you can take the
shuttle bus to Ames. Getting from the airport to I-35 in Des Moines is a little tricky;
see the map at <a HREF="http://www.external.ameslab.gov/Common/dsmmap.html">www.external.ameslab.gov/Common/dsmmap.html</a>
for route details. There are also good maps of Des Moines on Iowa State's web page at <a
href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/admap.html">www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/admap.html</a>.<br>

Ames is approximately 28 miles north of Des Moines (where Interstates 80 and 35 connect).

The Facilities, Planning, and Management department has a fantastic interactive map of
Iowa State University on their web page at <a href="http://www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps">www.fpm.iastate.edu/maps/</a>.
