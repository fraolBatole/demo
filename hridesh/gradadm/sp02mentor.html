Dear Admitted Student:
<P>
Congratulations on your admission to the Ph.D. program in Computer Science at Iowa State University.  The Graduate Admissions Committee was especially pleased to see your application among a very strong pool of applications for admission to the Computer Science Graduate Program at Iowa State.
<P>
Based on your stated interests, we have determined that certain faculty members would be potential mentors for you during your studies at Iowa State University.  You can find your mentor(s) on the following table.  Your name is being passed on to these faculty members, some of whom may contact you to further explore your interests in working with them.
 <P>
We can offer a limited number of teaching and research assistantships to highly qualified applicants who are committed to pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science.  Given the limited number of assistantships that are available, and the nontrivial effort needed on our part to arrange funding for international students, we can offer such assistantships to only those students who have both the ability, as well as the commitment, to pursue a Ph.D. degree. We would urge you to give this serious consideration since our ability to fund international students in the future is closely tied to the outcome of such funding to students with similar backgrounds. Consequently, we strongly discourage applicants who already possess a Master's degree from pursuing the M.S. degree in our graduate program. We expect the students who are admitted to the Ph.D. program, to begin studies and research leading to a Ph.D. upon their arrival at Iowa State University.
<P>
If after reviewing the information on research opportunities in the  laboratories of potential mentors listed above, and carefully evaluating your career objectives, you determine that you are interested in seriously pursuing a Ph.D. degree in Computer Science at Iowa State University, please respond to ldutton@admin.cs.iastate.edu as soon as possible. We will make every effort to offer you funding for the duration of the Ph.D. program (subject of course to satisfactory performance on your part after you arrive here), through a combination of teaching and research assistantships.
<P>
If you have specific questions concerning research projects being carried out in the laboratories and research groups of particular faculty members, we encourage you to contact them directly by email. When you write to them, please be sure to mention that you have been admitted to the Ph.D. program. Faculty web pages can be found at http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/facstaff.html.
<P>
Information will be provided for newly admitted students for Spring 2002 at a later date.
