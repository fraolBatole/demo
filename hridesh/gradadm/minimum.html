<h2>Admission Criteria for Graduate Program in Computer Science</h2>
</center>
<p>
Thank you for your interest in graduate program in Computer Science
at Iowa State University.  We recognize the time and expense students must
invest when they decide to apply for graduate study. This document
is intended to assist prospective students in determining whether they meet
the criteria for admission to the graduate program in Computer
Science at Iowa State University.  
<p>
<b>
A major goal of our graduate program is to provide high quality research-based graduate training in Computer Science leading to a Ph.D. degree. The department also offers an M.S. degree. Each year, we receive a very large number of applications from highly qualified candidates for our Ph.D. program in Computer Science.
Given limited resources, this means that 
we can only admit the most outstanding applicants among those who apply. Admission decisions are based on a careful evaluation and ranking of completed applications on the basis of criteria which include academic credentials, quality of undergraduate institution, letters of recommendation, research credentials (or potential), teaching experience (or potential), relevant work experience, aptitude test scores (GRE), written and spoken communication abilities,  and any other significant accomplishments.  
In 2003, a typical year, only the top 10% of our 800 applicants were admitted. Among the 80 or so applicants that were admitted, approximately 20-25 were offered financial aid in the form of teaching or research assistantships.  We expect this to be the same for 2004.
</b>
<p>
Applicants who do not satisfy the admission criteria outlined below
are discouraged from applying unless their application presents evidence of otherwise exceptional 
credentials (e.g., research experience, outstanding academic performance). 
<p>
<ul>
<li>
<b>Undergraduate work</b>:  A 4-year university degree is required (see below
for details). A bachelor's degree in Computer Science or a closely-related 
discipline is recommended.  However, otherwise exceptionally
well-qualified applicants who hold a 4-year bachelor's degree in another discipline but present strong evidence of research potential will be considered for admission.
Candidates should
read and complete the Graduate Applicant Self Evaluation Form 
available at <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/preapp.html">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/preapp.html</a> to determine whether or not they have the necessary undergraduate background.
<li>
<b>Academic Performance</b>: 
A cumulative undergraduate grade point average (GPA) comparable 
to a "B+" average or 3.30 out of a possible 4.00, and ranking in the top 
quartile (25%) of the graduating class. In the case of international 
applicants, this roughly translates to:
<ul>
<li>
For applicants from United Kingdom, Australia, India, New Zealand, Canada, and
Asian and African countries following the British University model,
a 4-year First Class Bachelor's Degree with
Distinction (3-year degrees are not acceptable) or a First Class   
master's degree with a minimum cumulative average marks of 60% or a
cumulative average grade of 7.5 or higher on a 10 point scale.
<li>
For applicants from Japan and Korea, a 4-year bachelor's degree with a cumulative score of 85% or 3.30 GPA on a 4 point scale and ranking in top quartile of graduating class.
<li>
For applicants from Taiwan (ROC), a 4-year bachelor's degree 
(3 or 5 year diplomas not acceptable) with a cumulative score of 80%,
and top quartile rank.
<li>
For applicants from China, a 4-year bachelor's degree from a University
with a cumulative score of 85% and ranking in top quartile of the graduating class. 
<li>
For applicants from countries in Western Europe, and Latin America, 4 or 5 year University degree and ranking in top quartile of the graduating class. 
<li>
For applicants from Eastern Europe and Russia, a 4 or 5 year University degree, with a minimum grade of 7.5 on a 10 point scale and ranking in top quartile of the graduating class.
</ul>
<li>
<b>Standardized Aptitude Test Scores</b>:  Submission Quantitative, Analytical, and Verbal Graduate Record Examination (GRE) scores (i.e., official score sheets from ETS for written or computer based tests or notarized copies of such score sheets) is REQUIRED.  Successful applicants typically have GRE scores that place them above the 90th percentile in quantiative and analytical sections (when such percentiles are reported by ETS).
GRE Computer Science Subject Test scores are not required, but recommended.  
<li>
<b>English Language Proficiency</b>:
In the case of international applicants, a score of 213 (550 PBT) or higher  
on the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) is required. 
The Test of Written English (TWE) and Test of Spoken English (TSE) are not required but are recommended. 
</ul>
