Fall 2010


Welcome to Iowa State University and the Dept. of Computer Science

We look forward to seeing your completed application materials and 
assisting you as you progress towards your future academic goals.

Offical applications are processed by admissions and sent to departments when complete.
Please be sure to send documents to the appropriate office.  Misdirecting your materials 
will delay your application processing.  Until we receive the official application packet from admissions, 
and match this with the departmental required documents, your status will show up as not complete.  

The CSID number you received is the one you will need to reference when checking your application status
at http://www.cs.iastate.edu/~gradadm/f10status.html

Please email any questions regarding application materials to the following address:  grad_adm@cs.iastate.edu

We look forward to seeing you at Iowa State University.
