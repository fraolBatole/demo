Dear Prospective Computer Science Graduate Program Applicant:</H4>

<p>
The Department of Computer Science welcomes applications for admission to the 
graduate program in Computer Science from highly-qualified applicants interested in obtaining research-based advanced training leading to a Ph.D. in Computer Science. The department also offers an M.S. degree in Computer Science. 
The Department has
strong research programs in Algorithms, Artificial Intelligence, Bioinformatics
and Computational Biology, Complexity Theory and Complex Systems, Databases,
Parallel and Distributed Computing, Programming Languages, Multimedia Systems,
Networks, Robotics, Software Engineering, and Theory of Computing. Information about the graduate program in Computer Science, faculty research interests, and degree requirements can be found at: <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/</a>. 
<p>
In addition to the M.S. and Ph.D. degrees in Computer Science, interdepartmental
Ph.D. programs in <a href="http://www.bcb.iastate.edu/">Bioinformatics and Computational Biology (BCB) </a>, <a href="http://wwww.hci.iastate.edu/">Human Computer Interaction</a> and <a href="http://www.neuroscience.iastate.edu/">Neuroscience</a> and an M.S. program in <a href="http://www.issl.iastate.edu/infas.html">Information Assurance</a> offer additional  opportunities for research-based training of Computer Scientists. Students interested in pursuing these opportunities should apply for admission to 
the respective intedepartmental program as well. Information about these programs can be found on the respective websites.
<P>We would like to bring to your attention the following items that often
prevent students from completing applications or beginning a graduate program
in our department:
<OL>
<p>
<LI>
The required application fee. Payment of the fee must be made in U.S. currency.  Applications will not be processed without the necessary fee.
NO FEE WAIVERS ARE POSSIBLE.
</LI>
<p>
<LI>
Admission to the graduate program in Computer Science is highly competitive.
The very high admission standards and resource limitations often 
prevent the admission of all but the most qualified applicants. Applicants are strongly urged to carefully review the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/minimum.shtml">admission criteria</a> before they apply.
Meeting admission criteria does not guarantee admission.
In 2003, a typical year, only the top 10% of our 825 applicants were admitted and of those, fewer than 25 were offered assistantships.
</LI>
<p>
<LI>
With the large volume of mail and email we receive, it is impossible for us to
respond to your individual questions and requests for assessment of prospects of admission or financial aid before evaluation of applications has been completed.
Under NO circumstances do we waive the official GRE, TOEFL, and OFFICIAL TRANSCRIPTS, or THREE LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION.  <U>All of these must be received by the deadline (January 1 for Fall; September 1 for Spring) in order for an application to be considered complete.  Incomplete applications cannot be evaluated. Consideration of applications that are completed after the prescribed deadlines will be deferred to the following semester.</u>
<p>
<LI>
There is a need for some personal funds for living expenses even for those
applicants who are offered financial aid, since the first paycheck is usually
issued by the University in September, roughly one month after the start
of classes (no salary advances are possible). It is inadvisable for students
who do not receive offers of financial aid to ASSUME that they will be
able to secure aid after arriving on campus. </u>
<p>
<LI>
Please complete the Graduate Applicant Self-Evaluation form below. If you are unable to fill in a large portion of this form, it is unlikely that your
current background is adequate for pursuing graduate study in Computer Science.
A completed Course Evaluation Form must be sent to the Department of Computer Science at <a href="mailto:grad_adm@cs.iastate.edu">grad_adm@cs.iastate.edu</a> in order for your application to be processed. 
PROVISIONAL ADMISSION to the graduate program in Computer Science DESPITE DEFICIENCIES in
certain areas REQUIRES EXCEPTIONAL ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS AND STRONG EVIDENCE OF
RESEARCH POTENTIAL.  Students admitted on a provisional basis 
 should be prepared to take undergraduate courses to remove the deficiencies
 prior to taking graduate courses. </u>
