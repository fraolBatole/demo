The emergence of <b>Computer Science</b> or
<b>Informatics</b> is
perhaps one of the most significant intellectual developments of the
twentieth century. Computer Science, broadly defined, is the study of 
information processes that underlie the structure, behavior, and interactions
in computational systems. The field encompasses a large body 
of knowledge about algorithms, processes, information, communication, 
languages, and systems. It offers a new paradigm for representing, processing,
acquiring, and communicating knowledge. 
<p>
Almost every aspect of everyday life has been transformed by Information Technologies enabled by Computer Science.  
There is a growing realization that Information  technology is
essential for solving critical problems in areas such as
fundamental science and engineering, education; the environment,
health care, and government operations. The recent explosive growth
in computer power and connectivity is reshaping relationships among
people and organizations, and transforming the processes of
discovery, learning, and communication.  As a result of these
technological advances, we have unprecedented opportunities for
providing rapid and efficient access to enormous amounts of
knowledge and information;  for studying vastly more complex systems
than was hitherto possible; and for advancing in fundamental ways
our understanding of information processes in natural and
artificial systems. Computer and Information Science plays a central
role in facilitating major advances in  human capability to
generate, model, and represent more complex and cross-disciplinary
scientific data from new sources and at enormously varying scales;
to transform this information into knowledge by combining and
analyzing it in new ways; to deepen our understanding of learning
and intelligence in natural and artificial systems; and to
collaborate by sharing knowledge and working together.
<p>Computer science is transforming several of the basic and applied sciences
including biological, physical, and cognitive sciences. The language of 
algorithms provides to the study of life and mind, what calculus
provided for the study of physics. Without the language of calculus
(which provided the tools for characterizing and quantifying
rates of change), it is hard to conceive of classical physics,
mechanics, and most branches of engineering. 
Computer programs embody new theories and dynamic models
of cognitive 
phenomena such as memory and learning, perception, language understanding, 
and problem solving; physical phenomena such as planetary
motion; biological processes such as evolution;
and social phenomena such as economic behavior.  Thus, computer science is fundamentally transforming the way we understand ourselves and the world around us.
<ul>
<li>
A new breed of scientists,
armed with knowledge of theory of computation and tools of computing, and training in the basic sciences, are making fundamental contributions in various scientific disciplines. Computer Science is central to entire new disciplines 
that are emerging almost overnight (e.g., bioinformatics, computational biology, computational neuroscience, computational physics, computational chemistry, computational drug design, medical informatics). 
<p>
<li>
A new breed of technologists trained in computer science as well as the appropriate scientific and engineering disciplines are developing sophisticated new technologies for computer aided design and manufacturing, simulation of complex manufacturing processes, drug design, computer-aided surgery, and virtual reality. 
<p>
<li>
The tools of information technology that were enabled by Computer Science  
are transforming agriculture and food production through advances in areas such as bioinformatics and precision farming.
<p>
<li>
The tools of Information technology that were enabled by advances in Computer Science are transforming business practices through the emergence of electronic marketplaces, electronic investing, electronic banking, sophisticated software tools for scheduling and workflow and inventory management, etc.
<p>
<li>
Information technology has become critical to major functions of the government in areas such as national defense, disaster management, and law enforcement.
<p>
<li>
Information technology is playing a key role in education and training using
virtual (simulated) environments especially in domains where real-world
training is hard to obtain or where mistakes in the real world can be 
extremely costly. Examples include flight training, surgical training, disaster management, etc.
<p>
<li>
In the social sciences, entirely new disciplines are emerging as a result of marriage between computer science and social science (e.g., computational organization theory, computational economics). 
<p>
<li>
In the humanities and the arts, new media and new avenues for creative expression through computer generated or computer assisted music, drawings, paintings, characters  (e.g., in movies) and multi-media art have resulted from advances in computer and information sciences.  
<p>
<li>
Our society is at the threshold of an era of intelligent artifacts which is being ushered in, to a large extent, by advances in Computer Science and Information Technology. Some of the developments around the corner include smart buildings,
smart highways, smart appliances, smart implants and prosthetic devices, smart vehicles, intelligent communication networks, and intelligent personal
information assistants.
