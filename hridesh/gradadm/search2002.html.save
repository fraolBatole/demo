<h3>Faculty Positions in <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/">Computer Science</a></h3>
<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"> 
We seek applications for several tenure-track faculty positions, 
primarily for assistant professors in Artificial Intelligence 
(especially machine learning and 
software agents), Distributed Systems, Information Assurance, Information 
Systems (including data mining, multi-media systems, internet-based systems), 
and Software Engineering. However, outstanding candidates at other ranks will 
also be considered. We are especially interested in candidates who will 
complement our existing strengths in these areas. Candidates for senior 
positions must have a strong record of research, teaching, and external 
funding. All positions require a Ph.D. in Computer Science or a closely 
related field, completed or in final stages, and strong evidence of research 
and teaching abilities. 
<p>
The department currently consists of 21 full-time tenure-track faculty and 
offers B.S., M.S., and Ph.D. degrees in <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/">Computer Science</a>. It also 
participates in interdepartmental graduate programs in <a href="http://www.bcb.iastate.edu/">Bioinformatics & Computational Biology</a>, and <a href="http://www.issl.iastate.edu/infas.html">Information Assurance</a>. Both programs are supported 
by large multi-year graduate training <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/grants.html">grants</a> from the National Science 
Foundation. The department has about 700 undergraduates, 60 MS students, 
and 40 Ph.D. students, and has research strengths in 
Algorithms and Complexity, Artificial Intelligence (machine learning, 
intelligent agents), Bioinformatics and Computational Biology, Databases, 
Data Mining, Distributed Computing, Information Assurance, Programming 
Languages, Multimedia Systems, Networks, and Software Engineering. 
<p>
A dynamic faculty, moderate teaching load (typically 3 courses per year with 
further reductions for junior faculty), strong graduate program, and 
well-funded research provide an excellent  work environment. In addition, 
interdisciplinary interactions facilitated by the Lawrence E. Baker Center 
for Bioinformatics and Biological Statistics, the Information Assurance 
Center, DOE Ames Laboratory, and Virtual Reality Applications Center, nurture 
leading edge and innovative research and education. 
<p>
Iowa State University is a major land-grant university located in Ames, Iowa. 
It is a pleasant, small, yet cosmopolitan city, with a population of over 
50,000 (about 26,000 students), a vibrant cultural scene, and a secondary 
school system that is among the best in the U. S. Ames ranks as the 2nd 
most livable small city in the U.S.
