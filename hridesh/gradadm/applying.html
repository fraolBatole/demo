<h2>Applying for Admission to Graduate Program in Computer Science</h2>
</center>


Thank you for your interest in graduate program in Computer Science
at Iowa State University. Before you apply for admission, please read
and complete the Self Evaluation Form which is available
at <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/preapp.html">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/preapp.html</a> and satisfy yourself that you meet the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/minimum.shtml">admission criteria.</a>
<p>
The Computer Sciences Department considers applicants for graduate study twice a year.  To be considered for admission in Fall semester admission,  we must receive your complete application (all of the items below) by January 1 and for Spring semester admission, we must receive your complete application by September 1. We will inform you of our decision by April 15 for Fall admission and October 30 for Spring Admission. </P>
<P>
It is now possible to receive application materials electronically. University application 
materials from the Graduate College can be obtained from the
<a href="http://www.applyweb.com/apply/isu/">Applications Section</a> and application materials from the Computer Science Department can be obtained from <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/index.html">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/index.html</a>.  
<P>
Iowa State University is now using a Self-Managed Application Procedure for graduate applications.  The checklist can be found at <a href="https://www.applyweb.com/apply/isu/grad_checklist.pdf">https://www.applyweb.com/apply/isu/grad_checklist.pdf</a>.  
<P>
International students need to send ALL materials including the Self-Managed Application Checklist to Graduate Admissions, Iowa State University, 100 Alumni Hall, Ames, IA  50011-2011. <a href="http://www.applyweb.com/apply/isu/instructi.html">Click here</a> for instructions for international applicants.  
<P>
U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents need to send ALL <a href="http://www.applyweb.com/apply/isu/instruct.html">application materials</a> to Graduate Admissions, Computer Science Department, 226 Atanasoff Hall, Ames, IA  50011-1041.  
<P>

<B>The information that Computer Science requires in addition to the information listed on the Self-Managed Application Checklist includes</b>:
<p>
COURSE EVALUATION FORM (GRADUATE APPLICANT SELF EVALUATION FORM): This departmental form can be obtained from <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/preapp.html">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/preapp.html</a>. This form must be complete and include the grade, mark, score, or percentage received in the courses listed. Your application will not be reviewed if this form is not completed. This form can be mailed with your other application materials. 
<P>
It can also be copied and pasted into a word processing program, then completed, and returned by email to <a href="mailto:grad_adm@cs.iastate.edu"</a>grad_adm@cs.iastate.edu</a>.
<P>
<B>Helpful information that is not required includes</B>:
<P>
RESUME: A 1-2 page resume listing the applicant's education, work experience, internships, etc. is helpful to the review process.
<P>
<B>Further explanation of required application documents</B>.
<P>
STATEMENT OF PURPOSE: A brief essay, no more than one page, about why you are interested in graduate study in Computer Science, your research interests, and what you propose to do with a graduate degree in Computer Science.</LI>
<P>
LETTERS OF RECOMMENDATION: We require three letters of recommendation from individuals (typically professors who are familiar with your work) in support of your application. Please use one <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/LetterRec.htm">Letter of Recommendation Form</a> for each recommendation. The form may also accompany a recommendation written on the recommender's official letterhead. The recommendation letter may also be sent in without the form.  Make sure your full name is written in the recommendation letter. These letters can be sent with the Self-Managed Application materials. If they are not sent as part of the Self-Managed Application, please send directly to Graduate Admissions, Computer Science Department, 226 Atanasoff Hall, Ames, IA  50011-1040. 
<P>
GRE SCORES: Official Quantitative, Analytical, and Verbal GRE scores are REQUIRED for all applicants. Advanced (subject) GRE in Computer Science is not required, but applicants are encouraged to submit advanced GRE scores.  
Since it takes approximately 4-6 weeks for the official copy of your test  
scores to reach ISU, please take your test early enough to allow the scores to
reach ISU prior to the application deadline.  
If you designate Iowa State University as one of the institutions to
which scores must be sent by ETS (while making arrangements to take the test), the scores go 
directly to the Graduate Admissions Office. Official scores must be received before the application is evaluated. You can include a photocopy in your application materials, but official scores are required for review.  We will use any official score from ETS.  
Information about GRE can be found at <a href="http://www.gre.org/">http://www.gre.org/</a>.
<P>
TOEFL SCORES: All applicants who completed part or all of their education in countries where English is not the ONLY official language are required to provide TOEFL scores. For applicants who are required to take TOEFL, Test of Spoken English (TSE) scores are also recommended although not required.  Both are offered by the Educational Testing Service. Official scores must be sent to us by ETS. Information on TOEFL can be found at <a href="http://www.toefl.org">http://www.toefl.org</a>.
Since it takes approximately 4-6 weeks for the official copy of your test  
scores to reach ISU, please take your test early enough to allow the scores to
reach ISU prior to the application deadline.  
If you designate Iowa State University as one of the institutions to
which scores must be sent by ETS (while making arrangements to take the test), the scores go 
directly to the Graduate Admissions Office. Graduate Admissions requires official (original) TOEFL before the application is complete and can be forwarded to Computer Science for review. 
<P>
<B>Application Status</b>
<P>
Each Computer Science applicant will be assigned an application tracking number which will be communicated to applicants who provide an email address when they apply to the Graduate Program in Computer Science. Applicants should note this number and save it for future reference. 
<P>
If your application is completed before the deadline, it can take 2-3 months
for the application to be evaluated. IF YOU ARE ADMITTED, WE WILL CONTACT YOU AS SOON AS YOUR APPLICATION HAS BEEN EVALUATED AND ADMISSION AND FINANCIAL AID DECISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE. BECAUSE OF THE LARGE VOLUME OF APPLICATIONS THAT NEED TO BE PROCESSED, WE CANNOT RESPOND INDIVIDUALLY TO YOUR EMAIL INQUIRIES CONCERNING THE STATUS OF YOUR APPLICATION.

form required for obtaining the necessary U.S. visa for international students 
cannot be started) until the student has been formally admitted by the Graduate College.
<P>
If a student has deferred admission entry date, please send updated transcripts or job information, an updated Course Evaluation Form, and an up-to-date Statement of Purpose. 
<P>
Previously denied applications are not reviewed for subsequent semesters without new information: i.e., new GRE with higher scores, additional Computer Science courses taken from a 4-year university, additional letters of recommendation, updated transcripts, etc.
