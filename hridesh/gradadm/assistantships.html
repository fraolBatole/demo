<h3>Graduate Assistantships, Fellowships, and Scholarships</h3>
</center>



<p>
Financial aid in the form of teaching and research assistantships, fellowships, and scholarships is availabale for 
qualified applicants who are admitted to the <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/index.html">graduate program</a> in
<a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/">Computer Science</a> or interdepartmental graduate programs such as
<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.iastate.edu/">Bioinformatics and Computational Biology</a> that offer research-based graduate training for Computer Scientists at <a http://www.iastate.edu/">Iowa State University</a>. Competition for financial aid is intense and award decisions are based on a careful evaluation of all of the applicants who have been admitted to the graduate program. 
<p>
<b>Graduate Assistantships</b>
<p>
The Computer Science Department typically offers assistantships to highly qualified applicants who have been admitted 
to the Computer Science graduate program. The number of assistantships available varies from year to year.
<p>
Beginning graduate students on assistantships currently receive a stipend of $1,330 per month.  The stipends are $1,430 
per month for students who have completed the MS requirements, and $1,530 per month for those who have passed the Ph.D. 
preliminary examination. Graduate assistants need to pay only resident tuition which is significantly lower than
non-resident tuition.  Other benefits include scholarship credit towards the assistantship recipient's tuition (one-half
reduction of resident tuition), enrollment in the student health insurance plan, and reduced tuition for the spouse.
<p>
The assistantship is considered a half time position which requires the assistantship recipient to work approximately
20 hours a week (performing the responsibilities associated with the award), maintain a minimum of 3.0 grade point
average, and take no more than 12 credits of coursework in each fall and spring semester and no more than 7 credits during
summer sessions.
<p>
<b>Graduate Teaching Assistantships</b>
<p>
All students admitted to the Computer Science Graduate Program are considered for teaching assistantships in Computer Science
if they have asked to be considered for financial aid when they apply.  There is no separate application for for teaching
assistantships (TA). Decisions on award of teaching assistantships is based criteria such as academic merit, research
potential, letters of reference, teaching experience (if any) and English language proficiency.  Continued support in the
the form of teaching assistantships is subject to satisfactory performance of the TA duties which normally include grading 
assignments, conducting recitation or student help sessions, occasional classroom instruction, and generally assisting
course instructors.
<p>
Occasionally, Computer Science graduate students can find teaching assistantships in Computer Science or
other departments on campus after their arrival at ISU. 
<p> 
<b>Graduate Research Assistantships</b>
<p>
Exceptionally meritorious applicants admitted to the Computer Science Ph.D. program whose applications offer strong  
evidence of research potential are considered for a limited number of graduate college funded research assistantships.
These research assistantships usually support the students in the first year of their graduate study
during which they are expected to participate in and contribute to the research program of a faculty mentor of their choice. Funding in subsequent years is subject to satisfactory academic progress towards a Ph.D. in Computer Science and satisfactory performance of the research assistantship duties which usually include performing research that is jointly agreed upon by the student and the faculty mentor. Continued funding can be in the form of a teaching assistantship offered by the department, a research assistantship offered by the faculty mentor, or a combination of both.
<p>
Most students in the graduate program are considered for research assistantships by their faculty mentors (major professors) 
as and when funds become available through research projects that are supervised by the professors.  In most cases, the award
of such assistantships is based on the student's academic and research performance in the graduate program at ISU under the
supervision of the faculty mentor. 
<P>
Exceptionally well-qualified students with clearly defined research interests are occasionally able
to obtain research assistantship offers from professors who have funded projects in areas of mutual interest prior to their 
arrival on campus. It is highly inadvisable for graduate students to seek or accept research assistantships in areas other
than the ones in which they plan to focus their graduate studies.
<p>
<b>Additional Funding Sources for U.S. Citizens and Permanent Residents</b>
<p>
Often, U.S. citizens and permanent residents who have been admitted to the graduate program in Computer Science or a 
related interdepartmental graduate program may qualify for fellowships or traineeships funded by training grants.  
During 1999-2004 there are several graduate traineeships available to applicants interested in research-based graduate
training in Bioinformatics and Computational Molecular Biology.  These traineeships are funded by an
<a href="http://www.bioinformatics.iastate.edu/IGERT/">Integrative Graduate Education and Research Training (IGERT) award</a> from the National Science Foundation.
These fellowships have a duration of 1-3 years and provide a stipend of $20,000 per year. In addition, tuition, fees, and health insurance are paid for the duration of the fellowship. Funds for textbooks and scientific journals, computer software and hardware, short courses, internships, travel, and related expenses are also available. 
<p>
Other funding opportunities may be available for qualified female and minority applicants who are U.S. citizens or permanent
residents.  The Department of Computer Science will make every effort to forward applications from qualified candidates whole 
interests match the focus of such training programs to the respective selection committees at ISU
for evaluation. However, qualified and interested applicants are encouraged to contact the programs directly. A list of current opportunities that the Computer Science Department is aware of are available at <a href="http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/index.html">http://www.cs.iastate.edu/gradadm/index.html</a>.
<P>
<b>ISU Premium for Academic Excellence (PACE) Award</b>
<p>
Each year the Graduate College offers the PACE award to 10-12 exceptionally qualified applicants who have been admitted
to the graduate program in Computer Science and have been nominated for the award by the Department of Computer Science.
The award duration can be 1 or 2 years based on the student's credentials and the availability of funds.  All students
who have been admitted to the graduate program are considered for nomination for this award by the Department of Computer Science.
<P> 
<b>Finding Financial Aid After Arrival on Campus</b>
<p>
U.S. citizens and permanent residents who are admitted to the graduate program
without financial aid are often able to find part-time employment (e.g.,
as programmers) either on campus or off campus in local companies. International students who do not
receive an assistantship offer prior to their arrival on campus are occasionally
able to find an assistantship after their arrival at ISU. However, 
under NO circumstances, is it advisable for such students to assume that
they will be able to find financial aid after arriving on campus.
<p>
<b>Requirements for Maintaining Funding</b>
<p>
In addition to the requirement of satisfactory performance of responsibilities
associated with teaching or research assistantships or fellowships,  
continuation of funding of students admitted to the Ph.D. program beyond the
first year is subject to satisfactory academic progress in the Ph.D. program. Similarly, continuation of funding of 
students admitted to the M.S. program is subject to satisfactory academic progress in the M.S. program.
