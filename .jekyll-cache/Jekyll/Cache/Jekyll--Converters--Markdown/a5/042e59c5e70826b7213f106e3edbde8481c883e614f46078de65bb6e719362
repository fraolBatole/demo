I"º<p>As researchers and public-health experts join forces to battle COVID-19, computer scientists from Iowa State University have developed a data science infrastructure that will drastically improve research efficiencies for scientists who study the novel coronavirus.</p>

<p>This first-of-its-kind infrastructure galvanizes sixty years of coronavirus research onto a single, searchable platform. In addition to saving time and reducing costs, this tool may lead to quicker research breakthroughs and also accelerate the time-to-market of effective antiviral therapies and life-saving vaccines.</p>

<p>â€œThere are more than 44,000 published papers on coronaviruses that could provide game-changing insights into COVID-19,â€ said Hridesh Rajan, interim chair of the Department of Computer Science and Kingland Professor of Data Science. â€œWeâ€™ve unified a large trove of research onto a single platform. Now, virologists, epidemiologists and public-health officials can harness this critical data from an organized, indexed and searchable database.â€</p>

<p>Human coronaviruses were first identified in the 1960â€™s.The common cold, as well as SARS and MERS are coronaviruses. SARS-CoV-2 is the novel coronavirus dominating current headlines and causing worldwide exponential growth of coronavirus disease, or COVID-19</p>

<p><b>Increasing the speed of research</b></p>

<p>With its user-friendly, web-based interface, Iowa Stateâ€™s innovative tool acts as a COVID-19 information superhighway of sortsâ€”enabling scientists to quickly and efficiently locate, navigate and analyze coronavirus research from all over the world.</p>

<p>â€œWeâ€™ve removed all barriers to entry for these researchers,â€ said Rajan. â€œThey donâ€™t have to spend time searching, storing or cleaning up the data. They can get started immediately because weâ€™ve completed that work for them.â€</p>

<p>A central graph, which is currently in development, will visually link these six decades of coronavirus research. Knowledge, data and research findings from thousands of peer-reviewed studies, journal articles and papers will be available and subdivided into key categories.</p>

<p>â€œThis segmenting will enable a richer analysis of three COVID-19 research focuses,â€ said Rajan. â€œThese categories include: The development of antiviral treatments; the discovery of a safe and effective vaccine; and the in-depth analysis of coronavirus origins and transmission rates which could lessen the likelihood of future coronavirus outbreaks,â€ said Rajan.</p>

<p>Rajan also notes that improving the logistics of coronavirus research could also foster increased scientific collaboration. Researchers from all over the globeâ€”across many scientific disciplinesâ€”can now join forces, share information and capitalize on prior research as they work to combat COVID-19.</p>

<p>Researchers from the Department of Computer Science at Iowa State University launched this critical cyberinfrastructure on March 29.</p>
