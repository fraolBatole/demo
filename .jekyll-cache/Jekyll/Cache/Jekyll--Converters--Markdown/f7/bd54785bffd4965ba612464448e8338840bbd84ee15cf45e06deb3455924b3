I"â<p>The Laboratory for Software Design at Iowa State University conducts research in
programming languages, compilers and software engineering.</p>

<p>Our overarching goal is to develop tools and techniques that enable better
design of software intensive systems: a better design that is easier and cheaper
to implement, verify and sustain and that is more portable across computing
platform differences.</p>

<p>Our three leading projects are <a href="http://paninij.org"><strong>Panini</strong></a>, a language
designed to enable safe and efficient concurrent programming by construction,
<a href="http://boa.cs.iastate.edu"><strong>Boa</strong></a>, a domain-specific language and
infrastructure for mining software repositories, and
<a href="http://ptolemy.cs.iastate.edu"><strong>Ptolemy</strong></a>, a language that strives to balance
expressiveness and modular reasoning for crosscutting concerns.</p>

<p>Our research meetings are in 216 Atanasoff Hall on Wednesdays from 9am-1pm.</p>
