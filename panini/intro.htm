Panini is an implicitly concurrent object-oriented programming language.
The main motto of Panini's design is that if programmers structure their
system to improve modularity in its design, they should get concurrency for free.
Panini's features are useful towards exploiting fine-grained concurrency in 
object-oriented programs.
