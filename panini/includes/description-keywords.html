<meta name="description" content="Panini is a programming language 
whose goals are to ease development of correct, scalable, and portable 
software for multicore, many core, heterogeneous & performance-asymmetric 
core, and cloud platforms. Panini provides new, implicitly concurrent, 
modularization mechanisms. If programmers use these mechanisms to 
structure their software system to improve modularity in its design, 
they get concurrency for free! Modularity implies concurrency. 
The language thus encompasses fundamental and practical efforts to 
unify modularization and parallelization mechanisms.

using better modularity. " />
