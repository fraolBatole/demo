class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">What is Capsule-oriented Programming?</span><br 
class="newline" />Capsule-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that aims to ease
development of concurrent software systems by allowing abstraction from
concurrency-related concerns. <br 
class="newline" />
</p><!--l. 22--><p class="indent" >   Capsule-oriented programming entails breaking down program logic into distinct
parts called capsule declarations and composing these parts to form the complete
program using system declaration.<br 
class="newline" />
</p><!--l. 26--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Who may benefit from capsule-oriented programming?</span><br 
class="newline" />Capsule-oriented programming is a suitable approach for programmers who don&#8217;t
want to be distracted by concurrency concerns so that they can focus on their
software&#8217;s logic. If you want your programming language to take care of your
concurrency concerns just like Java and C# handles your memory management
concerns then capsules-oriented programming is for you.<br 
class="newline" />
</p><!--l. 33--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Who may NOT benefit from capsule-oriented programming?</span><br 
class="newline" />Capsule-oriented programming may not be a suitable approach for a software project
if it is preferred in that project to manage every aspect of concurrency manually. This
is similar to why Java and C# are not suitable, if a software project requires manual
memory management and explicit pointer arithmetic.<br

class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Will I be able to use my existing object-oriented code?</span><br 
class="newline" />Mostly. All existing classes that do not have a main method would work as is. It is also
advisable to avoid using explicit concurrency features, e.g. threads, locks,
synchronized, etc since they may interfere with Panini&#8217;s internal mechanisms.<br

</p><!--l. 48--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">How are capsules different from Erlang actors?</span><br 
class="newline" />Capsules are different from Erlang actors in that capsules ensure messages arrive in
sequentially consistent order, as well as providing mutable state within the
actor.<br

class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">How are capsules different from Scala actors?</span><br 
class="newline" />Capsules are different from Scala actors because of the enforced confinement of a
capsule&#8217;s state.<br

<!--l. 65--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Why are capsules different from actors?</span><br 
class="newline" />The decision to make different choices in capsule&#8217;s design was based on two factors.
</p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">To  decrease  the  impedance  mismatch  between  mainstream  languages
      like  Java,  C#,  etc  and  the  capsule-oriented  programming  model.  In  the
      resulting design, inter-capsule procedure calls look like ordinary method
      calls in mainstream programming languages.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">We also simplified the language model a bit to make it feasible to build
      efficient, precise, and more automated analysis and compilation strategies.
      <br 
class="newline" /></li></ul>
<!--l. 76--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">How are capsules different from standard object-oriented classes?</span><br 
class="newline" />A capsule is like a class in that it also defines a set of public operations, hides the
implementation details, and could serve as a work assignment for a developer or a
team of developers. Beyond these standard responsibilities, a capsule also serves as a
memory region for some set of standard object instances and behaves as an
independent logical process.<br 
class="newline" />
</p><!--l. 83--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Why did you introduce new syntax for capsules and system?</span><br 
class="newline" />At first glance a capsule declaration may look similar to a class declaration, thus
naturally raising the question as to why a new syntactic category is essential, and why
class declarations may not be enhanced with the additional capabilities that capsules
provide, namely, confinement (as in Erlang) and an activity thread (as in previous
work on concurrent OO languages). There are three main reasons for this design
decision in Panini.<br 
class="newline" /></p>
      <ul class="itemize1">
      <li class="itemize">First, we believe based on previous experiences that objects may be too
      fine-grained to think of each one as a potentially independent activity.
                                                                         

                                                                         
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Second, we wanted to specify a system as a set of related capsules with a
      fixed topology, in order to make it feasible to perform static analysis of the
      system graphs; this implies that capsules should not be first-class values.
      </li>
      <li class="itemize">Third, there is a large body of OO code that is written without any regard to
      confinement. Changing the semantics of classes would have made reusing
      this vast set of libraries difficult, if not impossible. In the current design of
      Panini, since syntactic categories are different, sequential OO code can be
      reused within the boundary of a capsule without needing any modification.

class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">I believe I have just run into a compiler bug, how do I report it? </span><br 
class="newline" />All bugs in the Panini compiler can be reported by sending an e-mail to panini@<br 
class="newline" />iastate.edu. We would very much appreciate a self-contained source code file that
reproduces the bug along with your e-mail, but if you don&#8217;t have it you could also
describe what you were trying to do and send us buggy output of the Panini compiler.

class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Why do my files have the extension .java if I am writing Panini code?</span>
<br 
class="newline" />The Panini compiler was built on top of the Java OpenJDK compiler and, currently, we
re-use most of the infrastructure provided by it. Panini files will have their own
extension in future releases of the compiler. <br

</p><!--l. 127--><p class="indent" >   <br 
class="newline" /><span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">Can I compile all Java code with the Panini compiler?  </span><br 
class="newline" />All code that does not have use any explicit concurrency features (e.g. synchronized
keyword, threads, etc.) can be compiled using the Panini compiler. Also, the
Java main method no longer has any special meaning in the Panini language.
<br

<span 
class="ptmb8t-x-x-120">can some of them be removed?  </span><br 
class="newline" />Assuming you want your program to run, no. Currently, Panini programs first compile
to Java programs and then to bytecode, the extra files contain everything needed to
express Panini&#8217;s abstractions in Java.
