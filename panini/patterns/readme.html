The src folder contains the source code for the concrete
examples as well as the library classes
used to convert the sequential patterns into concurrency-enhanced
patterns.

<h3>
Dependencies
</h3>
The library classes themselves are precompiled as a jar file in the
lib directory named asynclib.x.y.z.jar (where x.y.z is the version number).
All examples depend upon this jar file. 
In addition, some examples depend 
on external libraries in the external-lib directory (indicated in
the README for the particular example).

<h3>
Annotation processing
</h3>
Many of the patterns depend on autogenerated code. By default, code
is autogenerated at runtime and then compiled using the dynamic compiler
API and loaded using a custom classloader that is part of the
library. However, it is generally preferable to have the necessary code generated
at compile time using the JDK annotation processing tool.  Annotations
are used, as described in the table below, to identify the participants
in a particular pattern.  <em>(Note: JDK 1.6 is required.)</em>
<p>
For further details on how the patterns library uses autogenerated
code, see the technical report at 
<a href="http://paninij.org/patterns">http://paninij.org/patterns</a>.

<h2>
Examples
</h2>
The bulk of this distribution consists of examples demonstrating
the Gang of Four (GOF) design patterns implemented in both
a sequential style and using a concurrency-enhanced
form of the pattern.  The root package for the examples is
org/paninij/concurrentPatterns/examples.  Each example 
has its own package with both a sequential and concurrent version.
In most cases there is a README in the sequential version that 
describes the example and a README in the concurrent version
describing the adaptation to the concurrency-enhanced pattern.

<h3>
Building the examples with the Ant build script
</h3>
All examples can normally be built using the <em>build</em> target. 
By default, the annotation processing tool places autogenerated code
in the bin directory.  Class files and autogenerated code can be
removed using the <em>clean</em> target.

<h3>
Building the examples with Eclipse
</h3>
<ol>
<li>Create a new, empty Java project
<li>Drag the src, lib, and lib-external directories into the project directory in the 
Package Explorer.  Allow the existing src directory to be overwritten.
<li>In the project Properties add the five jar files in lib and lib-external to the build path.
</ol>
At this point, the examples should all compile.  However, since annotation 
processing is not yet enabled, most examples will require the autogenerated 
code to be created, compiled, and loaded at runtime, often creating a noticeable 
pause in execution.  
<p>
<a name="eclipse_apt_instructions" />
<strong>To enable annotation processing in Eclipse:</strong>
<ol>
<li> In Project Properties -&gt; Java Compiler, be sure compiler compliance level to 1.6
<li> In Project properties -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Annotation Processing,
check &quot;Enable project specific settings&quot; and &quot;Enable annotation processing&quot;
 (&quot;Enable processing in editor&quot; doesn't matter, it won't work anyway).
The generated source directory: default is .apt_generated, which is fine.
<li>In Project properties -&gt; Java Compiler -&gt; Annotation Processing -&gt; Factory Path,
 check &quot;Enable project specific settings&quot;, click
 click &quot;Add JARs&quot; and browse to lib/asynclib-x.y.z.jar
<li>Confirm in the next dialog that the project will be rebuilt.
</ol>
After a rebuild, there should be a directory .apt_generated beneath the project
directory that contains the source files for the generated classes.  Building all the examples should result in four
packages under .apt_generated:
<ul>
<li>asyncdecorators
<li>asyncproxies
<li>ducks
<li>makers
</ul>
<h3>
Running the examples
</h3>
Most examples have an obvious entry point such as "Main".  The general package
structure and dependencies are described above.  For example, 
from the top-level directory a typical command line might look like:
<pre>
java  -cp lib/asynclib-0.1.3.jar;bin  org.paninij.concurrentPatterns.examples.abstractFactory.concurrent.financial.Main
</pre>



<h2>
Using the library
</h2>

<h3>
Compiling with javac
</h3>
To use the library, include lib/asynclib-x.y.z.jar on the build classpath.
The JDK 1.6 compiler will automatically discover the annotation processor
by examining the META-INF/services directory in the jar file.  Alternatively
it is possible to use the compiler option
<pre>
 -processor  org.paninij.concurrentPatterns.lib.aproc.AsyncProcessor
</pre>
However, in either case there is a catch, which is that all source files
containing annotations must be 
<em>explicitly given  as arguments to the javac command</em>
(either by name or via a wildcard).

For example, compiling Main.java in any of the example packages will always 
cause the remaining classes in the package to be implicitly compiled, but 
annotations in those files will not be processed, resulting in the warning
<pre>
warning: Implicitly compiled files were not subject to annotation processing.
Use -proc:none to disable annotation processing or -implicit to specify a policy
 for implicit compilation.
</pre>
(Note that the use of the -implicit:class option to javac will suppress the 
warning, but will NOT change the behavior of the annotation processor.)  
For a single package it is normally sufficient to compile *.java instead of Main.java.  
To compile an entire project it is probably simplest to generate a file containing a 
complete list of java source files and pass it to the javac command using the @ option, e.g.,
<pre>
find src | grep .java > argfile
javac -cp <em>your-class-path</em>  @argfile
</pre>

<h3>
Compiling with Eclipse
</h3>
To use the library in a project, include lib/asynclib-x.y.z.jar on the build classpath for the project.
Follow the <a href="#eclipse_apt_instructions">instructions above</a> to enable annotation processing in Eclipse.
