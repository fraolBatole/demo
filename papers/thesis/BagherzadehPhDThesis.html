<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="bagherzadeh2016toward">
    Modular reasoning and concurrent programming are both necessary for scalable
    development of performant software. Modular reasoning improves scalability by
    allowing a program to be understood one module at a time. Concurrent
    programming improves the performance by allowing simultaneous executions of
    multiple computations in a single program. However, modular reasoning about a
    con- current program is difficult because of its thread interference, module
    inheritance and nondeterministic message orders. The statement of this thesis
    is that there exists a concurrent programming model that enables modular
    reasoning about behaviors of its programs in the presence of interference,
    inheritance and nondeterministic message orders using the following three
    ideas.

    The first idea is an interference control framework that enables modular
    reasoning in the presence of interference. The technical innovations of the
    interference control framework are its sparse interference and cognizant
    interference properties that allow for standard Hoare-style modular reasoning
    about a concurrent program. Sparse and cognizant interference guarantee that
    interference happens only at explicitly specified program points and the
    interference behavior is statically known, respectively.

    The second idea is concurrent behavioral subtyping that enables modular
    reasoning in the presence of inheritance. The technical innovations of
    concurrent behavioral subtyping are a new definition of behavioral subtyping
    for a concurrent program in terms of standard interface subtyping and a novel
    interference subtyping and show that in the presence of encapsulated
    inheritance the interface subtyping is sufficient to guarantee concurrent
    behavioral subtyping.

    The third and last idea is order types that enables modular reasoning in the
    presence of nondeter- ministic message orders. The technical innovations of
    order types are to disallow message races using existential types that capture
    unknown module dependencies, abstraction that hides local messaging behavior
    of the module in its order type and a blame assignment that properly blames
    the module with bad expression composition or bad module composition and not
    the module in which the race happens.

    These three ideas have the potential to ease software engineering of
    concurrent systems by improv- ing a developer’s ability to design, implement,
    test and evolve their software one module at a time.
