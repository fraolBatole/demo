      We describe a solution for the SAVCBS challenge problem: a technique for
      specifying and verifying invariants for objects designed using the Composite
      design pattern. The solution presents a grey-box speciﬁcation technique using
      JML’s model program feature. We show that model program speciﬁcations function
      as exemplars for capturing helper method calls in a way that preserves
      modularity and encapsulation.
