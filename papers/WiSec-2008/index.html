<h4>Abstract</h4>
<p>
  <span id="hanna2008slede-b">
    Finding flaws in security protocol implementations is hard. Finding flaws in
    the implementations of sensor network security protocols is even harder
    because they are designed to protect against more system failures compared to
    traditional protocols. Formal verification techniques such as model checking,
    theorem proving, etc, have been very successful in the past in detecting
    faults in security protocol specifications; however, they generally require
    that a formal description of the protocol, often called model, is developed
    before the verification can start. There are three factors that make model
    construction, and as a result, formal verification is hard. First, knowledge
    of the specialized language used to construct the model is necessary. Second,
    upfront effort is required to produce an artifact that is only useful during
    verification, which might be considered wasteful by some, and third, manual
    model construction is error prone and may lead to inconsistencies between the
    implementation and the model. The key contribution of this work is Slede, an
    approach for automated formal verification of sensor network security
    protocols. Technical underpinnings of our approach includes a technique for
    automatically extracting a model from the nesC implementations of a security
    protocol, a technique for composing this extracted model with models of
    intrusion and network topologies, and a technique for translating the results
    of the verification process to domain terms. Our approach is sound and
    complete within bounds, i.e. if it reports a fault scenario for a protocol,
    there is indeed a fault and our framework terminates for a network topology of
    given size; otherwise no faults in the protocol are present that can be
    exploited in the network topology of that size or less using the given
    intrusion model. Our approach also does not require upfront model
    construction, which significantly decreases the cost of verification.
