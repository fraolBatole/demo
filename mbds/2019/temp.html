            Amy Slagell earned her B.S.C. in communication at Ohio University in 1983. She earned her M.A. and Ph.D. in rhetoric and American public address at the University of Wisconsin and, before coming to Iowa as the director of the public speaking program in 1996, spent several years teaching in Birmingham, Ala. From 2006-2013 Amy led the Speech Communication Program in the Department of English. Her research explores contemporary public speaking pedagogy and 19th century public address with a particular focus on the impact of cultural and institutional structures that constrain the visibility and rhetorical choices of women as public speakers.

            She has served as the Associate Dean for Academic Programs in the College since 2013.

            Chicago's data science team are able to predict and prioritize problems that might arose in the city, ranging from public health to sanitation. Built in-house, contemporary statistical methods and big data technologies are paired with real-life issues to improve the quality of life and improve efficiency. A growing number of teams are using and incorporating data science as part of their regular decision-making processes. This presentation will discuss the projects and how they are paired with daily operations.</p

            Dr. Kautz holds an M.S. in computer science and a Ph.D. in
            mathematics from Cornell University.  Prior to joining the teaching
            faculty at Iowa State he spent 10 years on the faculty of Randolph College of
            Lynchburg (Virginia) and then 8 years as a senior software engineer for
            NewMonics (later acquired by Aonix, Inc), the developers of the
            PERC(tm) virtual machine, a platform for real-time Java.  Dr. Kautz's
            time as an engineer was divided between work on the virtual machine
            itself, including contributions to several implentations of threads,
            and consulting services for customers.  As part of the latter effort he
            developed a one-week, hands-on course on concurrent Java that has been
            presented to teams of developers worldwide over an 8-year period.
            Dr. Steve Kautz is currently a lecturer of Computer Science at
            Iowa State University.
